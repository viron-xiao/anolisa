# ANOLISA Component Contract

This document defines where a packaged component exposes its ANOLISA
component contract and how ANOLISA should consume that contract across RPM and
raw backends.

## Package Location

RPM packages that expose ANOLISA component metadata MUST install the component
contract at:

```text
/usr/share/anolisa/components/<component>/component.toml
```

In RPM spec files, use the datadir macro rather than hard-coding
`/usr/share`:

```spec
%global anolisa_component sec-core

install -d -m 0755 %{buildroot}%{_datadir}/anolisa/components/%{anolisa_component}
install -m 0644 .anolisa/component.toml \
  %{buildroot}%{_datadir}/anolisa/components/%{anolisa_component}/component.toml

%files
%dir %{_datadir}/anolisa/components
%dir %{_datadir}/anolisa/components/%{anolisa_component}
%{_datadir}/anolisa/components/%{anolisa_component}/component.toml
```

Examples:

```text
/usr/share/anolisa/components/sec-core/component.toml
/usr/share/anolisa/components/tokenless/component.toml
/usr/share/anolisa/components/os-skills/component.toml
```

## Rationale

`component.toml` is static, package-owned, architecture-independent metadata.
Under the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, that makes `/usr/share` the right
system location.

Do not install the component contract under:

- `/etc`: reserved for administrator-editable configuration.
- `/var/lib`: reserved for runtime state.
- `/usr/libexec`: reserved for helper executables.
- `/opt`: reserved for private package trees, not ANOLISA discovery contracts.
- `/usr/share/anolisa/adapters/<component>`: reserved for adapter payloads.

The adapter payload tree remains separate:

```text
/usr/share/anolisa/adapters/<component>/<framework>/...
```

The component contract is component-level metadata. It may describe adapters,
services, health checks, files, backend compatibility, and future lifecycle
behavior, so it should not live inside the adapter namespace.

## User And Raw Installs

For user-mode or raw installs, the same logical datadir layout applies.
ANOLISA follows the user roots described by `file-hierarchy(7)`: the default
data root is `~/.local/share`, and `XDG_DATA_HOME` may override that data root.

The default location is:

```text
~/.local/share/anolisa/components/<component>/component.toml
```

When `XDG_DATA_HOME` is set, use the overridden data root:

```text
$XDG_DATA_HOME/anolisa/components/<component>/component.toml
```

Raw archives may also carry the source contract at:

```text
.anolisa/component.toml
```

ANOLISA should normalize that source contract into the installed datadir layout
or directly into the installed-state snapshot described below.

## Installed-State Snapshot

ANOLISA should keep package-owned contract files separate from its runtime
state. After install or adopt, ANOLISA may copy the resolved contract into its
state directory:

```text
{state_dir}/component-manifests/<component>/component.toml
```

Typical paths:

```text
/var/lib/anolisa/component-manifests/<component>/component.toml
~/.local/state/anolisa/component-manifests/<component>/component.toml
```

The package-owned contract is the source provided by RPM or raw artifacts. The
state snapshot is ANOLISA's runtime record and may be used by commands such as
`anolisa adapter enable <component> <framework>` after the component has been
installed or adopted.

## Discovery Order

For an installed component, ANOLISA should resolve the component contract in
this order:

1. Existing installed-state snapshot:
   `{state_dir}/component-manifests/<component>/component.toml`.
2. Package datadir contract:
   `{datadir}/components/<component>/component.toml`.
3. Raw archive source contract during install:
   `.anolisa/component.toml`.

If an RPM-installed component has no package datadir contract, commands should
treat adapter declarations as unavailable and report that the RPM does not
publish an ANOLISA component contract.

## Adapter Operation Notices

An adapter contract may declare static, display-only operator notices that
ANOLISA shows after `adapter enable` or `adapter disable` succeeds. Notices
are declared with `[[adapters.notices]]` on a generic adapter entry, or with
`[[adapters.openclaw.notices]]` / `[[adapters.hermes.notices]]` in a
framework-specific section (which takes precedence over the generic entry):

```toml
[[adapters]]
framework = "openclaw"
adapter_type = "plugin"
plugin_id = "tokenless"

[[adapters.notices]]
when = "post_enable"
level = "info"
text = "Restart the framework to load the plugin."
command = "openclaw restart"

[[adapters.notices]]
when = "post_disable"
level = "warning"
text = "Cached tokens remain until the framework restarts."
```

Each notice has:

- `when` (required): `post_enable` or `post_disable`.
- `level` (optional): `info` (default) or `warning`.
- `text` (required): the notice body.
- `command` (optional): a display-only command hint.

Notices are inert text. `text` and `command` are never shell-expanded,
template-substituted, or executed. Human-readable output escapes control
characters to protect terminal state, while structured JSON preserves the
declared values. Required framework configuration is not a notice — it stays
a structured `[[adapters.config]]` entry.

Display behavior:

- `adapter enable` shows `post_enable` notices after a successful enable;
  `adapter disable` shows `post_disable` notices after a successful disable.
  `post_disable` notices are taken from the enable-time receipt, so they are
  shown even if the component manifest is no longer present.
- Human-readable output prints the notices; `--quiet` suppresses them.
- `--json` returns the notices in a stable `data.notices` array.
- `--dry-run` previews the notices that a real operation would show, labeled
  as a preview; nothing is executed.

## Content Rendering (`render`)

A `[[component.layout.files]]` entry may request that ANOLISA render the
file *content* against the final filesystem layout before placing it:

```toml
[[component.layout.files]]
source = "share/anolisa/sec-core/agent-sec-core.service.in"
target = "{userunitdir}/agent-sec-core.service"
mode = "0644"
render = "anolisa-paths-v1"
```

`anolisa-paths-v1` substitutes the same placeholder vocabulary used for
destination paths — `{bindir}`, `{libdir}`, `{libexecdir}`, `{datadir}`,
`{etcdir}`, `{statedir}`, `{logdir}`, `{cachedir}`, `{unitdir}`,
`{userunitdir}` (and underscore aliases), plus `{component}` — inside the
file content. This makes shipped templates such as systemd units
relocatable: the rendered `ExecStart` and `ReadWritePaths` follow the
install mode and any custom `--prefix` instead of hard-coding
`/usr/local`.

Rules:

- `render` applies to a single regular file. Directory sources and
  symlink entries must not declare it.
- The content must be valid UTF-8; an unknown `{...}` token in the
  content fails the install. Rendering is opt-in per entry, so files that
  legitimately contain braces are unaffected unless they declare
  `render`.
- A brace token immediately preceded by `$` is left verbatim. `${VAR}` is
  a shell or systemd environment reference that the **consumer** resolves
  at runtime — a unit fed by `EnvironmentFile=`, for example — so ANOLISA
  neither expands nor rejects it. The exemption is purely lexical: write
  `{bindir}` to get layout expansion, never `${bindir}`, which ships
  verbatim and is then resolved at runtime as an unset variable. A layout
  placeholder nested inside such a token still renders, so
  `${SKILL_ROOT:-{datadir}/skills}` keeps the environment reference and
  resolves `{datadir}`, and an unknown nested name still fails the
  install.
- The `$` exemption applies to file content only. `target` and every other
  destination path is written by ANOLISA itself, with no shell or service
  manager in the loop, so `${VAR}` there is rejected as an unknown
  placeholder.
- The value is versioned. An installer that does not implement the
  declared value refuses the install rather than copying the template
  verbatim; pair new `render` values with a matching
  `min_anolisa_version`.
- The recorded file digest covers the rendered bytes, so integrity
  verification and repair operate on what is actually on disk.

The RPM backend does not render: RPM packages expand paths in their spec
at build time. `render` exists so the same source template serves both
packagings.

## Minimum CLI Version Gate

`[component.contract].min_anolisa_version` declares the oldest ANOLISA
CLI that can install the contract:

```toml
[component.contract]
schema_version = "1.0"
min_anolisa_version = "0.2.17"
```

Raw install and update compare it (SemVer) against the running CLI and
refuse the operation when the CLI is older, pointing the operator at
`anolisa self-update`. A value that is not valid SemVer is also refused.
There is no override flag: manifest parsing is tolerant, so an older CLI
would otherwise silently drop fields such as `render` and install a
broken result. Set the field to the **first released ANOLISA version
that ships** whichever contract behavior the component depends on —
never an earlier release that merely parses the field. Content
rendering, this gate, and backend-specific adapter roots all ship in
0.2.17; a contract using any of them must declare at least that.

### Bootstrap: protecting CLIs older than the gate itself

The gate only works once a CLI that evaluates it is running — released
CLIs ≤ 0.2.16 parse tolerantly, so they would ignore both
`min_anolisa_version` and `render` and install the raw template as-is.
No contract-side hook can stop them (verified against a real 0.2.16
build — repo `index.toml` `schema_version`, `components.toml` schema,
and the manifest's own tolerant `schema_version` all do **not** stop an
old CLI), so the protection lives in the distribution layout instead:

- `v1/index.toml` — the generation-1 index. Must only ever contain
  entries whose contracts pre-0.2.17 CLIs install correctly. This is
  the only file those released binaries read, and they parse it
  atomically: one entry shape they cannot represent would take every
  unrelated component down with it.
- `v1/index-v2.toml` — the complete generation-2 index (a full world
  view, not a delta; publish both files from the same pipeline run).
  Entries whose contracts depend on ≥ 0.2.17 semantics are published
  **only** here. 0.2.17+ CLIs read this file when present and fall
  back to `index.toml` when it is not.

An old CLI therefore keeps installing unrelated components untouched
and resolves a gated component as not-found — fail closed, no silent
mis-install and no collateral breakage. From 0.2.17 the index is also
parsed entry-tolerantly: a row this build cannot represent is skipped
with a warning, and any request that row may have answered (same
component and target; any version for "latest", the exact version when
pinned) is refused with a `self-update` hint rather than answered from
older parsable rows — skipping must never turn into a silent downgrade.
This split is a one-time measure: future entry shapes will not need an
`index-v3.toml`.

### Downgrade and rollback with trust anchors

Enabling an adapter whose resources live at an external RPM root
records a trust anchor in `installed.toml` and bumps its schema to
v6. Anchors are recorded only when the enabled receipt actually
depends on external trust: it must contain a symlink resource whose
*target* lies outside the trusted layout and datadir roots (today only
the Codex driver records such a symlink). An RPM contract whose
`resource_root` resolves inside the datadir, or an adapter whose
receipt carries no symlink resources, needs no trust migration and
keeps state at v5. Released
0.2.16 binaries refuse a v6 state file read-only (by
design — they would otherwise silently drop the anchor), so a direct
binary downgrade while an anchored receipt exists leaves state
commands refusing until the newer CLI runs again. The supported
downgrade path is: `anolisa adapter disable` any adapters of
RPM-provenance components with a declared
`[adapters.backends.rpm].resource_root`, which removes their anchors
— an anchor-free state is written back at schema v5, byte-compatible
with 0.2.16 — then downgrade the binary. No data is lost either way;
the v6 refusal is deliberate fail-closed, not corruption.

## Backend-Specific Adapter Resource Roots

For a unified raw/RPM contract, the adapter `dest` describes where a
*raw* install lays the bundle — and, for raw installs, where
`adapter enable` later reads it. An RPM package may carry the same
bundle at a package-owned path instead. Declare that path per backend:

```toml
[[adapters]]
framework = "openclaw"
source = "adapters/sec-core/openclaw"
dest = "{datadir}/adapters/{component}/openclaw/"

[adapters.backends.rpm]
resource_root = "/opt/agent-sec/openclaw-plugin/"
```

Selection follows the component's installed provenance recorded in
state:

- RPM-installed (managed, adopted, or observed) with a declared
  `resource_root`: scan/status/enable read the bundle from that root. It
  is read-only — ANOLISA never writes under it — and must be an
  absolute path or a `{datadir}`-rooted template (plus `{component}`).
  Other layout placeholders (`{bindir}`, `{libexecdir}`, …) are
  rejected: they would expand against the *consuming* scope's layout
  rather than the contract's — a user-mode manager consuming a system
  RPM contract would resolve them under the user prefix. A template
  whose expansion is not an absolute path is likewise rejected before
  any filesystem probe: a relative root would resolve against the
  process working directory.
- RPM-installed without a declared `resource_root`: resolution falls
  back to `dest` and convention discovery, as before.
- Raw-installed: `dest` semantics are unchanged; the RPM root is
  ignored.

A declared root is authoritative for its backend. When the directory is
missing or holds no valid bundle, the operation reports the expected
path instead of silently falling back — a missing RPM payload is a
packaging defect that must surface, not be masked by a stale raw
leftover in `{datadir}`.

## Contract Template

Use a shipped component manifest such as
[`manifests/components/cosh/component.toml`](../manifests/components/cosh/component.toml)
as the example schema for new component contracts.
