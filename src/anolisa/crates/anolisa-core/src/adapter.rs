//! Adapter detection and layout placeholder expansion.
//!
//! This module provides two core concerns for adapter management:
//!
//! 1. **Framework detection** — inspects the `detect` hints from an
//!    [`AdapterSpec`] to determine whether a framework (binary on PATH,
//!    well-known paths on disk) is present on the host.
//!
//! 2. **Placeholder expansion** — resolves layout placeholders such as
//!    `{datadir}`, `{bindir}`, and `{etc_dir}` in adapter `dest`/`source`
//!    paths against a concrete [`FsLayout`].
//!
//! All detection logic is side-effect-free: it never spawns processes or
//! writes to the filesystem.
