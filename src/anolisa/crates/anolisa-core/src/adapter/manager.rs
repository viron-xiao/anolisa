//! Adapter manager: the trusted orchestrator that owns the
//! dangerous-resource boundary.
//!
//! The Manager is the only thing that takes the install lock, reads and
//! writes adapter receipts in `installed.toml`, re-validates every
//! [`ClaimResource`](super::claim::ClaimResource) against a driver's static
//! external roots, runs framework CLIs through a single controlled
//! [`AdapterOps`] implementation, and records to the central log. Drivers
//! own framework *semantics*; the Manager owns *trust and IO*. A driver
//! never spawns a process, deletes a path, or persists state on its own.
//!
//! Resource discovery has two modes, tried in order:
//!
//! 1. **Contract-driven** — when the installed component manifest declares
//!    an `[[adapters]]` entry with a `dest` field, that template is expanded
//!    against each visible datadir root. The first root whose expanded path
//!    exists as a directory wins. When `dest` is declared but no directory
//!    exists, enable fails with an explicit error and scan shows the adapter
//!    as declared but absent — convention discovery is **not** used as a
//!    silent fallback.
//!
//! 2. **Convention** — `{datadir}/adapters/<component>/<framework>/`.
//!    Multiple datadir roots may be searched (e.g. the user datadir
//!    preferred over the system one); the first root that contains the
//!    directory wins.
