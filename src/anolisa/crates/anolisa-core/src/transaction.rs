//! Atomic lifecycle transactions with rollback support.
//!
//! A [`Transaction`] is a small journal that lifecycle operations
//! (install / enable / disable / uninstall / purge) can plug into to get
//! crash-safe behaviour without each call site re-implementing the
//! "snapshot → mutate → rollback on error" dance.
//!
//! The shape is intentionally concrete:
//!
//! 1. `begin` mints a sortable `operation_id`, snapshots the existing
//!    `state_path` bytes (if any) into a sidecar file under
//!    `journal_dir/<operation_id>.state.snapshot`, and writes an empty
//!    journal file under `journal_dir/<operation_id>.journal.toml` that
//!    references the sidecar by path and sha256.
//! 2. Each meaningful side effect (writing a file, modifying state,
//!    starting a service, …) records a [`TransactionStep`] up front with
//!    `Planned` status. The journal is rewritten atomically (`tmp` →
//!    `rename`) on every change so the file on disk is never half-written.
//! 3. On success the orchestrator calls [`Transaction::mark_done`]; on
//!    failure it calls [`Transaction::mark_failed`] and walks the journal
//!    backwards calling rollback primitives.
//! 4. After a crash, [`Transaction::load_journal`] reads the file back in
//!    so a later `repair` command can finish or rewind the operation.
//!
//! Journal format is TOML (human-greppable, lines up with `installed.toml`
//! and `enable-plan.toml`) and is rewritten in full on every mutation.
//! That full-rewrite strategy is only cheap under two invariants that
//! every caller must preserve:
//!
//! * **The journal never embeds data that grows with the managed state.**
//!   Byte bodies, per-file inventories, or hash lists must live in
//!   sidecar files referenced by path + sha256 (the state snapshot is the
//!   canonical example — schema v1 embedded it as a TOML integer array,
//!   which inflated a multi-MB state file ~9x and was re-serialised on
//!   every step transition, producing near-quadratic I/O on components
//!   with tens of thousands of owned files).
//! * **Step count never scales with the number of owned files.** Steps
//!   are phase-level (`PlaceFiles`, `RemoveOwnedFiles`, …); per-file
//!   progress belongs in an externally referenced inventory, never in
//!   per-file steps.
//!
//! With both invariants held the journal stays KB-sized, steps lists are
//! short (tens of entries per op at most), the rewrite cost is
//! negligible, and a single rewrite-and-rename guarantees the on-disk
//! file always parses.
//!
//! AgentSight is not mentioned anywhere on purpose: this primitive is
//! shared by every component the package manager knows about.

    //      following symlinks the test fires immediately.
    //

    //      confirm (a) two back-to-back writes don't collide and (b) a
    //      symlink planted at the *final* target gets atomically replaced
