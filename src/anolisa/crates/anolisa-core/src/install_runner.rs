//! Install runner: copy a cached artifact into the ANOLISA-owned layout.
//!
//! This runner supports `tar_gz` artifacts. It decodes a gzipped tar archive
//! once, streaming every entry the component contract selects into a private
//! staging directory under `cache_dir`, then places each staged payload at its
//! destination. Payload bytes are never retained in memory for the whole
//! archive: peak memory tracks the fixed streaming buffer plus per-entry
//! metadata, not the uncompressed artifact size.
//!
//! All destinations must resolve under one of the ANOLISA-owned roots
//! (`bin_dir`, `etc_dir`, `state_dir`, `lib_dir`, `libexec_dir`, `datadir`,
//! `log_dir`, `cache_dir`). Anything else is rejected as
//! `InstallError::ExternalPath`. The runner refuses to modify or even
//! create files outside those roots, so a failed install can roll back by
//! deleting just the paths it returns.
