# Changelog

[中文版](CHANGELOG_zh.md)

All notable changes to ANOLISA will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.8] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Tagged ANOLISA releases now include verified prebuilt CLI archives for Linux
  x64, Linux arm64, and macOS arm64. Users can download a standalone binary
  archive for each supported target directly from the GitHub Release
  ([#2883](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2883)).

### Fixed

- Raw installs now preserve `${VAR}` references in rendered file content for
  shell and systemd consumers, while continuing to expand nested ANOLISA layout
  placeholders and reject environment references in destination paths.
  `anolisa install cosh-ng --backend raw` can now install the gateway service
  template instead of rejecting its `EnvironmentFile=`-backed workspace
  reference as an unknown placeholder
  ([#2903](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2903)).

## [0.3.7] - 2026-08-25

### Changed

- Source and RPM builds now require Rust 1.93, with the rustup toolchain pinned
  to 1.93.1 and Cargo dependency resolution constrained by the declared MSRV.
  Builders can use the newest compiler packaged by Alibaba Cloud Linux 4
  without Cargo selecting dependencies that exceed the supported compiler;
  older Rust toolchains must be upgraded
  ([#2810](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2810)).

### Fixed

- `anolisa --dry-run restart <component>` now lists the units that would be
  restarted without invoking `systemctl daemon-reload` or `systemctl restart`.
  System-mode previews read recorded state without taking the exclusive install
  lock, so they no longer require write access to the state root
  ([#2774](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2774)).

## [0.3.6] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- `anolisa --quiet adapter scan` and `anolisa --quiet adapter status` now
  suppress all non-error human output, including empty-state messages and
  result tables, while `--json` continues to emit the standard envelope.
  Agents can rely on quiet adapter inspection producing no human output
  ([#2752](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2752)).
- `anolisa --dry-run forget <component>` now refuses a component that still
  has enabled adapters with the same `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, exit code 2, and
  `adapter disable` guidance as the real operation. Previews no longer report
  that an impossible forget would succeed, while unrelated adapter receipts
  remain ignored
  ([#2762](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2762)).

## [0.3.5] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- Uninstalling a component with a bare systemd service template now stops
  every loaded instance through `name@*.service` before disabling the declared
  `name@.service` template. Template-backed services no longer remain running
  after `anolisa uninstall`, while individual stop failures continue to surface
  as warnings without blocking cleanup
  ([#2603](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2603)).

## [0.3.4] - 2026-08-19

### Changed

- Component-targeting commands now use the repository component index as the
  sole authority for names absent from local state. Installed and recovery
  identities remain usable offline, while unsupported names return
  `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, an unavailable index returns `EXECUTION_FAILED`, and
  `NOT_INSTALLED` now reliably means a supported component is absent. A
  `--repo` override also governs identity and package selection for the whole
  invocation, so site-local package mappings and RPM `Provides` metadata can
  no longer establish unrecognized component names
  ([#2637](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2637)).

### Fixed

- Missing local Raw repository index errors now identify whether the active
  repository came from the exact `repo.toml` path or a one-off `--repo`
  override and provide matching recovery guidance. Users no longer need to
  guess which source configured the missing repository
  ([#2650](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2650)).

## [0.3.3] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- Telemetry instance snapshots now include the detected container runtime as
  `instance.container` for Docker, Podman, containerd, Kubernetes cgroups, and
  LXC, while bare-metal hosts omit the field. This gives downstream deployment
  statistics and troubleshooting a container-aware signal without collecting
  container or pod identities
  ([#2642](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2642)).

### Changed

- `anolisa status <component>` now validates new targets against the component
  index, resolves package aliases, rejects unsupported names with `anolisa list`
  guidance, and directs telemetry service targets to
  `anolisa telemetry status`. Exact installed identities remain inspectable
  when repository metadata is unavailable
  ([#2626](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2626)).

### Fixed

- Raw adapter bundle installs now preserve each archive file's mode and record
  the effective mode for integrity checks. Framework hooks and scripts retain
  their executable bit instead of being installed uniformly as data files
  ([#2619](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2619)).

## [0.3.2] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- ANOLISA now provides a native DSH adapter driver for plugin bundles.
  `anolisa adapter enable <component> dsh --profile <name>` accepts repeatable
  profiles, validates the bundle identity, delegates profile changes to DSH,
  and remembers the enable-time DSH home so status, disable, and re-enable keep
  targeting the same profiles even if `DSH_HOME` or the working directory
  changes. Disable DSH adapters before downgrading to an earlier ANOLISA release
  ([#2580](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2580)).
- `anolisa logs --level <LEVEL>` is now a visible alias for the existing
  `--severity` option, with the same validation and filtering behavior while
  `severity` remains the canonical JSON field
  ([#2558](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2558)).

### Changed

- `anolisa list` and `anolisa install --all` now evaluate component
  availability against an exact OS and architecture target from schema v2
  `components-v2.toml`. JSON output replaces `platforms` and
  `platform_available` with `targets` and `target_available`; repository
  publishers must deploy the v2 index beside the unchanged v1 index
  ([#2533](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2533)).

### Fixed

- `anolisa --dry-run install` now reads `meta.toml` beside the resolved Raw
  artifact before falling back to version-level metadata only when the sibling
  file is absent. Previews now validate the selected target's contract, reject
  corrupt published metadata instead of masking it, and still avoid downloading
  the artifact
  ([#2551](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2551)).
- System-helper status now reports `unknown` when `systemctl` cannot be started
  and reports `failed` only for a unit whose actual state is failed
  ([#2604](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2604)).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- Adapter discovery now excludes undeclared shared resource directories unless
  a contract, receipt, or built-in framework driver identifies them as real
  adapters. Shared assets such as Tokenless common hooks no longer appear as
  unsupported frameworks in adapter scan and status output
  ([#2502](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2502)).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- Adapter enable, status, and update now derive adapter revisions from
  ANOLISA-owned Raw files or native package metadata instead of hashing whole
  resource trees. Runtime caches and other unowned files no longer cause false
  drift or get copied into frameworks, while changed package-owned inputs block
  enable before framework mutation and unavailable metadata is reported with
  an `unknown` status
  ([#2419](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2419)).
- Re-enabling adapters now removes only stale materialized files recorded by the
  previous receipt, preserves runtime-created files, previews the cleanup with
  `--dry-run`, and retains the old receipt when a directory-to-file replacement
  would discard runtime data
  ([#2438](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2438)).

## [0.2.20] - 2026-08-11

### Changed

- `anolisa list` now announces the detected host platform and reports component
  availability instead of backend and ownership columns in human-readable
  output. Components unsupported on the host remain visible with their
  supported platform and no install action, while JSON adds `platforms` and
  `platform_available` without removing backend or ownership metadata
  ([#2367](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2367)).

### Fixed

- npm installs now keep `@anolisa/cli` as the sole owner of the public
  `anolisa` executable. With npm 10, local installs reliably create
  `node_modules/.bin/anolisa` instead of losing the command when platform
  packages are linked
  ([#2345](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2345)).

## [0.2.19] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Raw installs that provision system dependencies now map resolver-provided
  `rpm` and `deb` package-family hints directly to the matching package
  manager backend. Minimal supported hosts no longer report an unsupported
  package base merely because the optional `which` command is absent, while
  distro-specific hints remain compatible
  ([#2314](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2314)).
- `anolisa --json osbase sandbox list` and
  `anolisa --json register status` now use the standard success envelope with
  `ok`, `schema_version`, and `command` metadata and nest business fields
  under `data`. Scripts can parse these legacy commands the same way as other
  JSON surfaces
  ([#2319](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2319)).
- OpenClaw adapters now honor `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` with OpenClaw-compatible
  whitespace, tilde, and absolute-path handling, keeping plugins, skills,
  receipts, status, and disable operations on the configured state.
  Re-enabling safely migrates resources recorded under the legacy fallback,
  preserves the old receipt when cleanup must be retried, and previews the
  migration during `--dry-run`. If an older receipt used an `OPENCLAW_HOME`
  that is no longer present in the environment, temporarily restore it before
  migration or cleanup
  ([#2337](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2337)).

## [0.2.18] - 2026-08-06

### Changed

- Telemetry upload now treats `SLS_PROJECT_PREFIX` as an SLS project prefix
  and appends the detected region, for example `anolisa-cn-hangzhou`.
  Deployments that set the legacy `SLS_PROJECT` must migrate to
  `SLS_PROJECT_PREFIX` so uploads reach their region-specific project
  ([#2260](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2260)).

### Fixed

- Raw installs now stream only selected archive payloads through private,
  disk-backed staging instead of retaining uncompressed contents in memory.
  Large packages can install with bounded payload memory while preserving
  atomic placement, rollback, cleanup, and digest verification
  ([#2250](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2250)).
- `anolisa status` and `anolisa doctor` now hash ANOLISA-owned files up to
  2 GiB and treat larger files as unchecked and degraded instead of failed.
  Intact components with large artifacts no longer appear damaged or trigger
  spurious repair, while recovery still fails closed when verification is
  required
  ([#2271](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2271)).
- Enabling a Codex adapter that declares hooks now discovers the installed
  plugin's hook identities and atomically persists their trusted hashes, so
  non-interactive `codex exec` sessions can run them. Missing hooks or
  overridden trust settings stop enablement with actionable diagnostics
  ([#2281](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2281)).

## [0.2.17] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Raw installs can now render layout placeholders such as `{bindir}` and
  `{datadir}` inside declared text files before placement, so shared package
  templates follow the selected install scope and prefix. Integrity checks and
  repair use the rendered bytes
  ([#2222](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2222)).

### Changed

- Raw repository resolution now prefers the generation-2 index when published
  and enforces each component's minimum CLI version. Incompatible entries fail
  with an `anolisa update self` hint instead of silently installing an older or
  malformed result, while generation-1 repositories remain compatible
  ([#2222](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2222)).
- RPM-backed adapter scan, status, and enable operations now use a declared
  package-owned resource root and report a missing or invalid root instead of
  falling back to stale raw files. Codex adapters that target an external RPM
  root record a trust anchor; disable them before downgrading to `0.2.16`
  ([#2222](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2222)).

### Fixed

- Qoder native plugin bundles now use Qoder's own plugin lifecycle instead of
  being copied or rewritten as legacy hook bundles. Existing same-ID plugins
  across user and project scopes are protected, and unverified installs or
  removals retain a retryable receipt rather than claiming or deleting user
  state
  ([#2221](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2221)).

## [0.2.16] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Successful `anolisa update <component>` and `anolisa update all` operations
  now report adapters whose resource bundles changed, with the exact
  `anolisa adapter enable ...` or `anolisa adapter status ...` follow-up
  command. JSON responses expose the same information through stable
  `adapter_actions` arrays
  ([#2018](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2018)).

### Fixed

- Raw system-scope installs on Debian-family hosts no longer fail with
  `rpm not found on PATH` when both RPM tooling and an RPM database are absent.
  An existing or newly appearing RPM database still stops the raw install
  before files change
  ([#2061](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2061)).

## [0.2.15] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Interactive `anolisa install`, `anolisa install --all`, and
  `anolisa uninstall` now display phase-based activity during long-running
  planning and execution. ANSI-capable terminals animate the current phase,
  while limited interactive terminals print static phase lines
  ([#2036](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/2036)).

### Changed

- Human-readable failures now use conventional `error:` and `hint:` labels
  without exposing machine codes. `--json` retains structured error codes, and
  exit statuses remain unchanged.
- Update notifications now quote the recommended `sudo anolisa upgrade` and
  `anolisa update --check` commands so their boundaries are clear.

## [0.2.14] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- `anolisa status` and `anolisa doctor` now detect Unix mode and Linux file
  capability drift for raw-managed files, including installations recorded by
  earlier releases, and recommend `anolisa repair` for recovery.
- `anolisa repair` now replays raw-managed components when only file metadata
  has drifted, restoring declared modes and confirmed capabilities. Failed
  updates restore only capabilities known to have been active before the
  operation, avoiding optional grants that never applied
  ([#1987](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/1987)).

## [0.2.13] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- The `@anolisa/cli` npm package now supports macOS arm64 and selects the
  matching native binary during installation.
- Tokenless adapters now support Qwencode while keeping the Cosh extension
  independent from shared hook assets.

### Fixed

- Raw installs now refuse to provision a system package reserved by another
  pending RPM install and direct the user to `anolisa repair`, preventing
  components from claiming or later removing each other's dependencies.
- `cosh-ng` RPM installations now retain the `cosh-ng` component identity.
  Unambiguous legacy records and recovery journals stored as `cosh` are
  repaired so lifecycle commands target the correct component.
- Failed raw updates and repairs now restore file permissions and capabilities
  during rollback, keeping restored binaries executable.
- Enabling the Tokenless Qoder adapter now resolves shared hook paths in the
  cached plugin, preventing matching tool calls from failing because of broken
  hook commands.

## [0.2.12] - 2026-07-27

### Changed

- Commands that act on an installed component now report an absent target as
  `NOT_INSTALLED` instead of `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, so a caller can tell "there was
  nothing to act on" from "the invocation was wrong" without parsing the error
  message. The code reports state absence only, and does not indicate whether
  the name was valid. Affects `uninstall`, `update`, `repair`, `forget`,
  `restart`, and `adapter`; the exit code stays 2
  ([#1915](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/1915)).

### Fixed

- Adapter status now ignores empty or incomplete stale source directories and
  reports missing bundles as degraded; raw uninstalls prune empty directories
  so another installation scope cannot be shadowed
  ([#1850](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/1850)).
- Raw install dry-runs now validate component conflicts before execution,
  keeping preview results aligned with real installs. Repositories without
  lightweight sidecar metadata warn that conflict validation was skipped
  ([#1898](https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa/pull/1898)).

## [0.2.11] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Raw `anolisa install --version` now installs the exact published component version.
- Raw `anolisa install --version` output now reports requested and resolved versions, artifact URL, and source repository.

### Changed

- Raw `anolisa install --version` now lists published alternatives when the requested version is unavailable.

### Fixed

- Raw `anolisa install --version` no longer installs another version when the requested version is unavailable.
- Raw component uninstalls with many files now complete faster and write substantially less data.
- Recovery now preserves installed state when operation recovery data is missing or corrupted.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- `anolisa unregister` no longer leaves earlier telemetry configurations reporting.
- `anolisa install --version` no longer changes the host when the requested RPM is unavailable or incompatible.
- `anolisa install --version` no longer records success when a different RPM version is installed.
- `anolisa repair` now rejects interrupted RPM installs whose installed version differs from the original request.
- `anolisa repair` now reports when an interrupted RPM install's architecture cannot be verified.
- `anolisa adapter disable` now shows saved follow-up notices even when component files are unavailable.
- Adapter notices can no longer inject terminal formatting into human-readable output.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-07-22

- Lifecycle mutations now remain within the selected scope, including package aliases.
- The first modifying command now upgrades legacy state and preserves `installed.toml.v4.bak`.
- Newer state formats now produce an error instead of appearing empty.
- `install-anolisa.sh` now leaves distribution index retrieval to the CLI, keeping mirror data current.
- `install-anolisa.sh` now stages only OS-base manifests because component manifests are fetched when needed.
- `install-anolisa.sh --strict` now validates only binary and manifest bundle checksums.
- `ANOLISA_INDEX_URL` and `ANOLISA_INDEX_SHA256` no longer affect `install-anolisa.sh`.
- Lifecycle JSON output now includes explicit plans across install, adopt, update, repair, and uninstall.
- Uninstall JSON output now uses one schema for raw and RPM components, including package removal and plans.
- `anolisa uninstall --dry-run` now reports missing components as errors instead of empty successful plans.
- `anolisa forget` and `anolisa restart` now stop while an earlier component operation needs recovery.
- `anolisa doctor` now reports incomplete operations even without an active component record.

### Fixed

- RPM component updates now refresh saved component manifests before reporting success.
- Incomplete RPM manifest refreshes now appear in `anolisa logs --severity warn`.
- Interrupted RPM updates now remain repairable instead of appearing successful with stale settings.
