# Shell Integration and Typed Cards

[中文版](shell-integration-and-card-types_zh.md)

## Status

Implemented for an explicit hook-free Native startup, Enhanced Assisted as the
default, typed input ownership, inline Agent input, and same-process routing
switching inside Enhanced sessions. Direct Exec remains an internal reserved
type with no user entry point or visible state.

## Decision

`cosh` starts with `ShellIntegration::Enhanced` in the Assisted routing
substate. This preserves the pre-change product behavior: marker and OSC
command events, implicit natural-language classification, slash commands, and
Agent handoff remain available by default.

Users may select `ShellIntegration::Native` at startup. The child bash or zsh
then owns all ordinary input and loads its normal startup files. Cosh does not
generate a marker rcfile, install a `DEBUG` trap, change `PROMPT_COMMAND`,
enable `extdebug`, `functrace`, or `errtrace`, expose a marker token, observe
commands, or provide post-command insights.

```toml
[shell]
integration = "native"
```

```bash
COSH_SHELL_INTEGRATION=native cosh-shell
```

Invalid integration values reject startup with a visible error. Integration is
fixed for the life of the child Shell because enabling Enhanced inside a
running native Shell would require injecting state into that process.

Within an Enhanced session, `Shift+Tab` at an empty main prompt toggles AI
routing without restarting the child Shell. The Shell process, working
directory, variables, functions, and jobs remain intact. This is a routing
substate of Enhanced, not a conversion to hook-free Native integration: OSC
markers remain installed so Cosh can prove prompt ownership and switch back
safely.

## Input Ownership and Visible State

Symbols primarily describe who owns editable input before Enter, not output
that has already been produced. `InputOwner` stores this state; renderers never
infer routing from the first character of user text.

| Symbol | State | Owner | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| None | Native | Child Shell | Every byte goes directly to the PTY. Cosh does not decorate the user's original prompt or observe command events. |
| `◌` | Enhanced Shell-only | Child Shell, observed by Cosh | Ordinary input, including `hello`, `/`, and `??`, remains Shell input. Enhanced marker integration stays loaded so post-command insights and safe switching remain available. |
| `◇` | Enhanced Assisted | Shell executes, Cosh may route | Cosh may observe, classify, or route the submitted line before Shell execution. |
| `◆` | Agent | Agent runtime | `/agent` opens a borderless inline Composer that continuously shows `◆ ` before editable text. Any text, including `ls`, is an Agent request. |
| `/` | Cosh Command | Cosh control plane | Explicit slash command, intercepted only in Enhanced Assisted. |

`◇ ` and `◌ ` are outer-terminal decorations anchored to the Enhanced hook's
`prompt_ready` boundary. They are not added to PS1/PROMPT and are also applied when
Cosh restores the prompt after an Agent or panel interaction. Prompt replay
deduplication tracks the original prompt bytes, preventing duplicate ownership
symbols while preserving arbitrary ANSI, CJK, multiline, Bash, and Zsh prompts.

At an empty Enhanced main prompt, `Shift+Tab` replaces `◇ ` with `◌ ` and
disables Cosh input interception. Pressing it again restores `◇ ` and routing.
A non-empty
Shell line receives the key sequence unchanged, and an active prompt ghost or
card keeps its existing `Shift+Tab` behavior. This prompt-boundary gate keeps
the shortcut out of PS2, heredocs, foreground programs, and full-screen apps.

`DirectExec` and its `▶` symbol are reserved in the internal type model for a
possible future structured-`argv` executor. Because no executor or user-facing
entry exists, `▶` is not part of the current visible input states.

`/mode analysis` values `manual`, `smart`, and `auto` govern background failure
analysis and suggestion policy. They do not change the current input owner;
input ownership and background analysis are orthogonal states.

Native input bypasses candidate buffering, prompt ghosts, slash routing, and
card capture. Terminal control such as signals, resizing, and EOF still follows
the PTY lifecycle.

## Output Event Cards

Output identity is stored as `CardKind`. Output symbols describe event types;
they do not participate in input routing or grant permission.

| Symbol | Event | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| None | Agent Response | The title and frame already identify an Agent response, so the input-state `◆` is not repeated. |
| `/` | Slash Command | Cosh control-plane result. |
| `*` | Tool Call | Structured Agent tool invocation. |
| `!` | Permission | System-created request bound to a concrete run, request, tool use, tool name, and input. |
| `·` | System | Read-only status or notice. |

The current UI renders event symbols for slash panels, tool invocations,
permission cards, and system notices. Agent responses keep their framed title
without `◆`. Shell output remains the native terminal stream.

Permission cards can be constructed only from a structured
`ToolPermissionRequest`. Text such as `! allow` remains content in its existing
card and cannot grant permission. Output beginning with any card symbol is not
recursively interpreted.

## Effect on Related Issues

Native integration provides the clean architectural boundary requested by
#2687: a user can choose a session where marker options and traps do not exist,
instead of hiding their observable state. Enhanced v2 also removes the global
`DEBUG` trap and no longer forces `extdebug`, `functrace`, or `errtrace`. It uses
bounded prompt, command-not-found, and PTY integration points while preserving
the user's trap definitions and option state, which closes the observable
contract in #2687 without claiming that Enhanced is injection-free. Enhanced
Assisted remains the default to preserve existing product semantics.

The remaining Enhanced integration surface is explicit: `PS0`,
`PROMPT_COMMAND`, `_cosh_*` helpers, `command_not_found_handle`, and scoped
`COSH_*` state. Native remains the strict zero-injection choice. Xtrace output
tracked by #2683 and exit-status or signal correctness tracked by #2541 remain
separate contracts.

## Known Limits

- Changing `shell.integration` still requires a new `cosh-shell` session.
- `Shift+Tab` switches only the routing substate of an Enhanced session; it
  cannot add Enhanced hooks to a Native child Shell.
- Native integration intentionally has no implicit natural-language routing,
  slash interception, command-boundary ledger, marker handoff, or insights.
- The current Native session has no safe in-terminal Agent hotkey or panel
  because prompt ownership cannot be proven without additional integration.
- Direct Exec has no user entry or rendered input state.
- Enhanced integration is bounded rather than injection-free; users requiring
  no prompt, helper, environment, or command-not-found integration must start
  a Native session.
