//! SQLite-backed durable storage for the Gateway task plane.
//!
//! The store owns one write connection and commits task events, projections,
//! command receipts, and Outbox intents in one immediate transaction.
//!
//! The raw Task writer is intentionally not part of the production API:
//! ```compile_fail
//! let mut store = cosh_gateway::storage::SqliteTaskStore::open_in_memory().unwrap();
//! store.commit_task(todo!());
//! ```
