"""Regression tests for the cosh extension PreToolUse rewrite matcher.

cosh-ng's built-in shell tool is named ``shell`` on the wire (lowercase
snake_case), while the matcher historically only listed shell tool names
used by other agents (``Bash``, ``Shell``, ``run_shell_command``, ...).
On cosh builds without the hook-system tool-name alias table the rewrite
hook therefore never fired and rtk command rewriting was silently skipped.

The extension manifest must match cosh's real tool name directly instead
of relying on host-side aliasing: these tests pin the matcher against the
exact names cosh fires PreToolUse with, plus the negative space of cosh
tools that must never be rewritten.

Matching semantics mirror cosh-ng's ``HookSystem::matches_tool``: the
matcher is compiled as a regex and applied as an *unanchored* search
(Rust ``Regex::is_match`` ≈ ``re.search``); a matcher that fails to
compile would fall back to exact string equality, which the anchored
alternation here never triggers.

These tests pin the matcher against Python's ``re``. The Rust ``regex``
crate side of the contract — the engine cosh-ng actually compiles the
matcher with — is pinned by the ``cosh_extension_matcher_contract`` test
in the tokenless-cli crate. Both suites draw their tool-name corpus from
the shared ``tests/data/cosh_matcher_corpus.json``, so the two sides
cannot drift apart.
