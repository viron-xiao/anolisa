# Token-Less

[中文版](README_zh.md)

**LLM token optimization toolkit** — schema/response compression + command rewriting + tool environment readiness.

Token-Less combines complementary strategies to minimize LLM token consumption:

- **Schema & Response Compression** — Compresses OpenAI Function Calling tool definitions and API responses via the `tokenless-schema` library, cutting structural overhead before tokens ever reach the context window.
- **TOON Context Compression** — Encodes JSON responses to TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) format via the `toon-format` library linked into `tokenless`, reducing syntax overhead for suitable structured data.
- **Command Rewriting** — Integrates [RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) to filter and rewrite CLI command output, eliminating noise that would otherwise waste 60–90% of tokens.
- **Tool Ready (legacy, hard-disabled)** — Its pre-call dependency checks are retained in source but unconditionally bypassed while the readiness model is redesigned.

Agent adapters are available for:

- **OpenClaw plugin** — covers command rewriting, response compression, and schema compression in one plugin.
- **copilot-shell hook** — intercepts Shell commands via a PreToolUse hook and delegates to RTK for command rewriting + output filtering.
- **Hermes Agent plugin** — response compression, TOON encoding, command rewriting (block + suggest), and registered but hard-disabled Tool Ready via Hermes's native plugin system.
- **Qoder CLI plugin** — registered but hard-disabled Tool Ready, command rewriting, and response compression via Qoder's native hook system.
- **Claude Code plugin** — RTK command rewriting, response/TOON compression, and registered but hard-disabled Tool Ready via Claude Code's official plugin marketplace.
- **Codex plugin** — response compression, TOON encoding, registered but hard-disabled Tool Ready, and command rewriting via Codex's native hook system.
- **OpenCode plugin** — schema/response/TOON compression, registered but hard-disabled Tool Ready, and command rewriting via OpenCode's local plugin API.
- **DeepSeek Harness plugin** — native response compression and environment-error attribution through DSH's `tools/post-execute` seam.

For framework developers, the self-contained Python SDK and separate **AgentScope integration**
cover schema compression, RTK rewriting, response compression, TOON, retrieval, and attribution.

The schema, response, and TOON figures above are isolated Tokenless 0.7.11
results on the repository's committed reference fixtures; they are neither a
production range nor additive. Compression depends on payload size and shape,
removable fields, configured thresholds, and the share of tool data in the
session. Short or already compact payloads may save only a few percent or pass
through unchanged. See [Measuring Tokenless Savings](../../docs/user-guide/en/token-saving/tokenless/measuring-savings.md#run-the-repository-reference-workload)
for the exact inputs, command, full output, and limitations.

## Applicable Scenarios & Expected Effects

tokenless optimizes the tool-related content it handles—tool schemas, tool/API
responses, and supported shell output—before it enters the LLM context. It does
not touch model reasoning or conversation history. The payoff depends heavily
on the share and shape of that content in the session.

### Where it pays off

| Workload | Primary strategy | Why |
|----------|-----------------|-----|
| Shell-heavy (build/test/triage) | Command rewriting (RTK) | `cargo`/`npm`/`go`/`pytest` output carries lots of progress/warning noise; RTK cuts 60–90% |
| API/fetch-heavy (REST, web_fetch) | Response compression + TOON | JSON may carry removable debug/null/empty fields; sufficiently large, regular structures also have reducible syntax overhead |
| Agents with many tools | Schema compression | Many Function Calling definitions carry verbose descriptions and removable metadata |
| Long responses that must stay faithful | Reversible compression (Stash) | Truncated content is `retrieve`-able end-to-end lossless; thresholds can be tightened safely |

### Where it pays little or doesn't apply

- **Chat-heavy / few tool calls**: tool-response share is tiny, overall savings approach 0.
- **No fixed minimum payload**: `compress-schema` and `compress-response` build a
  candidate for every accepted valid JSON input. In active mode, they emit it only
  when its estimated token count is strictly lower than the original. A small input
  with removable content can still compress, while a larger already-compact input can
  pass through unchanged; the CLI writes the reason to stderr and records no stats.
  In dry-run mode, the CLI always emits the original and may record a smaller candidate
  as a predicted saving.
- **Model inference tokens / billed tokens**: outside what tokenless touches.

### Estimating the effect

> The shares below are **illustrative estimates** that vary widely by task, not measured constants.

| Session component | Typical share | tokenless can optimize |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| LLM reasoning output (text generation) | ~35% | ❌ Not involved |
| LLM input (system prompt + conversation history) | ~40% | ❌ Not involved |
| Tool call arguments | ~5% | ❌ Not involved |
| **Tool responses (API returns + command output)** | **~20%** | **✅ Optimization scope** |

**Actual savings rate = reported compression rate × tool response share**

Example: dashboard shows 60% compression rate, but if tool responses account for 20% of total consumption, the actual savings rate is 60% × 20% = **12%**. This is why savings feel "lighter than a feather" in experiments consuming 15 million tokens — tokenless only optimizes the ~3 million tokens of tool responses.

> Stash makes compression **end-to-end lossless**: you can tighten truncation thresholds for higher inline savings and recover the original via the `<<tokenless:KEY>>` marker when needed, with no correctness impact. Use `TOKENLESS_COMPRESSION_ENABLED=0/1` dual runs to compare real savings.
> See [user manual](../../docs/user-guide/en/token-saving/tokenless/user-manual.md) for per-strategy trigger conditions.

## Quick Start

Install the published component with the ANOLISA CLI:

The install script places `anolisa` in `~/.local/bin`, and a user-mode
Tokenless installation places `tokenless` and `rtk` in that same
directory. Export it once if the current shell has not picked it up yet.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.agentic-os.sh | bash

# Make the default install directory available in this shell
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
anolisa --version
anolisa install tokenless
tokenless --version
```

Alinux users with the YUM repository configured may install the RPM instead:

```bash
sudo yum install anolisa tokenless
sudo anolisa --install-mode system adopt tokenless
```

Installing the CLI from the same YUM repository makes it available on sudo's
system path. `adopt` then records the directly installed RPM in system state so
adapter commands can use its component contract.

Current public packages support Linux x86_64/aarch64 and macOS Apple Silicon.
Intel macOS does not currently have a published package. The repository's npm
packaging sources are for release construction and are not a public
`anolisa-tokenless` installation route. The retained
`@anolisa/tokenless-darwin-x64` optional-dependency entry describes a release
build target; it does not indicate registry availability.

ANOLISA-managed and adopted RPM installations place the available adapters
without changing an Agent product's user configuration. Run these commands
as the user who owns that configuration, and enable only the adapter you need:

```bash
anolisa adapter scan
anolisa adapter enable tokenless openclaw
anolisa adapter status tokenless
```

DeepSeek Harness requires at least one explicit profile name. When enabling
multiple profiles, pass every name in the same command; see the plugin section
below for the complete-set behavior. Use an enabled name when starting DSH:

```bash
anolisa adapter enable tokenless dsh --profile <profile>
dsh --profile <profile>
```

Developers building from source can use:

```bash
# Clone repo (no submodules needed)
git clone <repo-url>
cd Token-Less

# Full setup: build + install binaries + deploy all adapters
make setup
```

The source setup installs `tokenless` to `~/.local/bin`, places the `rtk`
helper alongside it, and deploys all adapters for development.

### Build the Python runtime

Framework authors can build the in-process Python API from source:

```bash
make python-wheel
python3 -m venv /tmp/tokenless-python
/tmp/tokenless-python/bin/pip install target/wheels/anolisa_tokenless-*.whl
```

This target requires a discoverable CPython 3.11+ development environment and
uses `uvx` to provision Maturin by default. Install
[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) first, or run
`make python-wheel MATURIN=maturin` with a compatible Maturin already on
`PATH`. The same Python environment is required by `cargo test --workspace`;
plain workspace-default Cargo commands exclude the Python extension.

The `anolisa_tokenless` module supports CPython 3.11 and later on the platform
where its native wheel was built. It exposes the four Tokenless lifecycle
methods and bundles the matching RTK executable; TOON is linked into the native
runtime. It does not require the Tokenless CLI or system helper binaries. The
package is built and tested in this repository but is not yet published to
PyPI. See the [runtime design](docs/design/runtime-library.md)
and the [user manual](../../docs/user-guide/en/token-saving/tokenless/user-manual.md#build-the-python-runtime-from-source).

The same wheel provides typed, read-only statistics queries without requiring
the CLI. Point `TokenlessStats` at the state directory used by the runtime, or
use the lazy `sdk.stats` client:

```python
from anolisa_tokenless import TokenlessStats

stats = TokenlessStats("/absolute/path/to/tokenless-data")
summary = stats.summary()
print(summary.total.tokens_saved, summary.total.tokens_saved_percent)
```

Token counts are estimates and only operations with positive savings are
recorded. `show()` and detailed `diff()` results may contain sensitive tool
input and output stored in `stats.db`. Read-only describes the API surface:
opening the client follows CLI initialization and may create or migrate
`stats.db`, so the data directory must be writable. `summary(limit=None)` and
`compare(..., limit=None)` inspect at most the newest 10,000 records. For a
session or tool-use diff, at most the newest 10,000 matching records are read.
For a meaningful comparison, pass a dry-run session first and an active
Tokenless session second.

## CLI Usage

The standalone `compress-schema` and `compress-response` commands use this
content-dependent savings check rather than a fixed byte or character minimum.
The description, string, array, and depth limits in the
[CLI reference](../../docs/user-guide/en/token-saving/tokenless/cli-reference.md)
trigger individual transformations; they are not minimum total payload sizes.
Agent adapters may apply separate pre-check thresholds; see the
[framework integration guide](../../docs/user-guide/en/token-saving/tokenless/framework-integration.md#adapter-processing-rules).

### compress-schema

Compress a single tool schema:

```bash
# From file
tokenless compress-schema -f tool.json

# From stdin
cat tool.json | tokenless compress-schema
```

Compress a batch of tools (JSON array):

```bash
tokenless compress-schema -f tools.json --batch
```

A top-level request object with a `tools` array is also accepted without
`--batch`; OpenAI wrappers, Gemini `functionDeclarations` tool objects, and
bare Function Calling declarations are compressed while non-function tools and
fields outside `tools` are preserved:

```bash
tokenless compress-schema -f request.json
```

### compress-response

Compress an API response:

```bash
# From file
tokenless compress-response -f response.json

# From stdin
curl -s https://api.example.com/data | tokenless compress-response
```

Long arrays are truncated to a head+tail window: the first
`--truncate-arrays-at` items (default 32) plus the last
`--array-tail-preserve` items (default 8), with a truncation marker in
between; pass `--array-tail-preserve 0` for head-only truncation. By default
`compress-response` stashes the dropped middle segment so it can be retrieved
later (see [Reversible compression](docs/stash-reversible-compression.md)).
Pass `--no-stash` for lossy truncation, or `--stash-db <path>` to override the
stash database (default `~/.tokenless/stash.db`).

### retrieve

Recover a payload stashed during `compress-response`. Accepts a bare 24-hex
hash or any text containing a `<<tokenless:HASH>>` marker:

```bash
# Bare hash
tokenless retrieve c30ccf5ed1125e0ed871ba8e

# Or paste the whole truncation line — the hash is extracted automatically.
# (Use the FULL 24-hex hash from your output; the value below is shorthand.)
tokenless retrieve "<... 160 items truncated, retrieve with <<tokenless:c30ccf5ed1125e0ed871ba8e>>"
```

### compress-toon / decompress-toon

Encode JSON to TOON format (or decode back to JSON):

```bash
# Encode JSON to TOON
echo '{"name":"Alice","age":30}' | tokenless compress-toon
# name: Alice
# age: 30

# Decode TOON back to JSON
echo 'name: Alice\nage: 30' | tokenless decompress-toon
# {"name":"Alice","age":30}
```

### Inspect token savings

Use `stats summary` for totals, `show` for the stored before/after payload, or
`diff` to explain the estimated token saving and highlight only changed lines:

```bash
tokenless stats summary
tokenless stats summary --limit 1000
tokenless stats summary --compare <baseline-session> <active-session>
tokenless stats show 42
tokenless stats diff 42
tokenless stats diff --session <session-id>
tokenless stats diff --session <session-id> --tool-use-id <tool-use-id>
tokenless stats diff 42 --json
```

`stats summary --limit` must be a positive integer; `--limit 0` is rejected at
parse time. `--compare` fails if either session has no records instead of
reporting 0% savings. Session overviews contain metrics only. Record and
tool-use reports include a unified content diff; consecutive active stages are
linked only when their stored output/input content matches exactly, avoiding
duplicate intermediate token counts. See
[Measuring Tokenless Savings](../../docs/user-guide/en/token-saving/tokenless/measuring-savings.md)
for options and measurement limits.

### Database location

Tokenless stores statistics and reversible-compression data in
`~/.tokenless/stats.db` and `~/.tokenless/stash.db`. Set one directory for both:

```bash
export TOKENLESS_DATA_DIR="$HOME/path/to/tokenless-data"
```

The directory may be any absolute path the current user can access, including
a managed service directory under `/var/lib`; filesystem root, relative paths,
and parent traversal are rejected. The existing `TOKENLESS_STATS_DB`,
`TOKENLESS_STASH_DB`, and `--stash-db` overrides take precedence but must stay
under the real user home or selected data directory. Configuration remains at
`~/.tokenless/config.json`.

## copilot-shell Hooks

The adapter provides hooks that are auto-discovered by copilot-shell via the cosh extension manifest:

| Hook | Event | File | Description |
|------|-------|------|-------------|
| Tool Ready (hard-disabled) | PreToolUse (all tools) | `tool_ready_hook.sh` | Silent pass-through; no check, repair, context, or block |
| Command rewriting | PreToolUse (Shell) | `rewrite_hook.py` | Rewrite commands via RTK |
| Response compression + attribution + TOON | PostToolUse | `compress_response_hook.py` | Compress + env error attribution + TOON |
| Schema compression | BeforeModel | `compress_schema_hook.py` | Compress tool schemas |

### Install

```bash
make cosh-extension-install  # or: make openclaw-install, make hermes-install
```

Hooks are registered via the cosh extension manifest (`cosh-extension.json`) and auto-discovered by copilot-shell — no manual `settings.json` configuration needed.

## Tool Ready

Tool Ready was designed to prevent wasted LLM tokens from retrying commands that fail due to missing environment dependencies.

**Legacy behavior**: Before each tool call, the `tool_ready_hook.sh` hook checked the tool's dependency list (from `tool-ready-spec.json`). Missing dependencies could produce `NOT_READY` with "Skip retry" guidance.

Tool Ready is currently hard-disabled across all adapters. Its registered hooks return before reading the dependency specification, checking the environment, attempting repair, or emitting a block decision. No environment variable can re-enable the legacy behavior; doing so requires an intentional source change and a new release.

Post-tool failure attribution, response compression, command rewriting, TOON encoding, Stash, and statistics are independent and remain active.

### env-check CLI

```bash
# Report the disabled state for a specific tool
tokenless env-check --tool Shell

# Report the disabled state for all tools
tokenless env-check --all

# Report the disabled state for checklist mode
tokenless env-check --checklist

# Machine-readable disabled state; no tools/summary checklist is emitted
tokenless env-check --checklist --json

# Accepted for compatibility; does not inspect or repair the environment
tokenless env-check --tool Shell --fix
```

These commands currently report that Tool Ready is hard-disabled and do not inspect or modify the environment.
Every JSON mode returns exactly the same three-field schema:

```json
{"tool":"checklist","status":"UNKNOWN","enabled":false}
```

`tool` identifies the requested tool or the `all`/`checklist` scope. The dormant
legacy `tools` and `summary` checklist fields are never emitted while the hard
bypass is active.

### Configuration

The dormant legacy per-tool dependencies remain in `tool-ready-spec.json`
(shipped within the adapter bundle at `common/tool-ready-spec.json`). The hard
bypass does not read this file:

```json
{
  "Shell": {
    "required": [
      { "binary": "jq", "package": "jq", "manager": "apt" }
    ],
    "recommended": [
      { "binary": "rtk", "version": ">=0.35", "package": "rtk", "manager": "cargo",
        "fallback": [
          { "method": "symlink", "binary": "rtk", "source": "/usr/libexec/anolisa/tokenless/rtk" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

String format `"jq"` is also supported (auto-converts to object).

## OpenClaw Plugin

The plugin hooks into the OpenClaw agent loop at two stages:

| Hook | Event | Action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tool Ready | `before_tool_call` | Registered silent pass-through; no check, repair, context, or block | ⛔ Hard-disabled |
| Command rewriting | `before_tool_call` | Rewrites `exec` commands to RTK equivalents for filtered output | ✅ Active |
| Response compression | `tool_result_persist` | Compresses tool results before they enter the context window | ✅ Active |
| Schema compression | — | Not supported by OpenClaw's hook system | ⏳ → ✅ |

**Response compression details:**
- Automatically compresses results from all tool types (`web_search`, `web_fetch`, `read_file`, etc.)
- Skips `exec` tool results when RTK is enabled — RTK already produces optimized output, avoiding double-compression
- Observed savings: **~78%** on `web_fetch` results, varies by content type

Each hook degrades gracefully — if the corresponding binary (`rtk` or `tokenless`) is not installed, that hook is silently skipped.

### Configuration

Options in `openclaw.plugin.json`:

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `rtk_enabled` | `true` | Enable RTK command rewriting |
| `schema_compression_enabled` | `true` | Enable tool schema compression (pending OpenClaw support) |
| `response_compression_enabled` | `true` | Enable tool response compression via `tool_result_persist` |
| `verbose` | `true` | Log detailed rewrite/compression info |

## Hermes Agent Plugin

The plugin registers hooks at three Hermes events, covering five strategies:

| Strategy | Event | Action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tool Ready | `pre_tool_call` | Registered silent pass-through; no check, repair, context, or block | ⛔ Hard-disabled |
| Command rewriting | `pre_tool_call` | Blocks original command, suggests `rtk`-rewritten version (one extra round-trip) | ✅ Active |
| Response compression | `transform_tool_result` | Compresses tool results via `tokenless compress-response` | ✅ Active |
| TOON encoding | `transform_tool_result` | Pipeline step after response compression — encodes JSON to TOON format | ✅ Active |
| Session tracking | `on_session_start` | Propagates agent/session IDs for stats recording | ✅ Active |
| Schema compression | — | Not supported by Hermes hook system (no hook exposes tool schemas) | ⏳ Blocked |

**How command rewriting works in Hermes**: Hermes's `pre_tool_call` hook can only block tool execution (not modify arguments), so the plugin blocks the original shell command and returns a message suggesting the RTK-rewritten version. The agent then re-executes with the optimized command, adding one extra tool-call round-trip. This is safe — `rtk rewrite` only does text substitution and never executes the command.

Each hook degrades gracefully — if the corresponding binary is not installed, that hook is silently skipped.

### Install

```bash
make hermes-install
```

Enable the plugin:

```bash
hermes plugins enable tokenless
```

Or add to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled:
    - tokenless
```

## Qoder CLI Plugin

The plugin registers hooks at three Qoder events, covering three strategies:

| Strategy | Event | Action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tool Ready | `PreToolUse` | Registered silent pass-through; no check, repair, context, or block | ⛔ Hard-disabled |
| Command rewriting | `PreToolUse` | Rewrites shell commands via RTK for token savings | ✅ Active |
| Response compression | `PostToolUse` | Compresses tool responses and encodes to TOON format | ✅ Active |

Each hook degrades gracefully — if the corresponding binary is not installed, that hook is silently skipped.

### Install

```bash
make qoder-install
```

## Claude Code Plugin

The plugin registers hooks at two Claude Code events, covering four strategies:

| Strategy | Event | Action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tool Ready | `PreToolUse` | Registered silent pass-through; no check, repair, context, or block | ⛔ Hard-disabled |
| Command rewriting | `PreToolUse` (Bash) | Rewrites shell commands via RTK for token savings | ✅ Active |
| Response compression | `PostToolUse` | Compresses tool responses and encodes to TOON format | ✅ Active |
| TOON encoding | `PostToolUse` | Pipeline step after response compression — encodes JSON to TOON format | ✅ Active |

Claude Code v2 requires plugins to be sourced from a registered marketplace. We expose the adapter's `claude-code/` directory as a single-plugin marketplace (`anolisa-tokenless`), then install `tokenless@anolisa-tokenless` from it. The marketplace name is component-scoped so multiple ANOLISA components can each register their own without colliding.

### Install

```bash
make claude-code-install
```

## Codex Plugin

The plugin registers hooks at four Codex events, covering four strategies:

| Strategy | Event | Action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Session check | `SessionStart` | Verifies tokenless CLI is installed and functional (non-blocking) | ✅ Active |
| Tool Ready | `PreToolUse` | Registered silent pass-through; no check, repair, context, or block | ⛔ Hard-disabled |
| Command rewriting | `PreToolUse` | Rewrites shell commands via RTK for token savings | ✅ Active |
| Response compression | `PostToolUse` | Compresses tool responses and encodes to TOON format, injects compressed summary as `additionalContext` | ✅ Active |

> **Codex Protocol Constraint**: PostToolUse hooks cannot suppress the original tool output. The plugin injects a compressed *summary* as `additionalContext` — the model sees both the original output and the compressed summary.

### Install

```bash
make codex-install
```

## OpenCode Plugin

The local plugin uses OpenCode's mutable tool hooks, so compressed output
replaces the original model-visible response instead of being appended to it.

| Strategy | Event | Action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tool Ready | `tool.execute.before` | Registered silent pass-through; no check, repair, context, or block | ⛔ Hard-disabled |
| Command rewriting | `tool.execute.before` (bash) | Rewrites shell commands via RTK | ✅ Active |
| Response + TOON compression | `tool.execute.after` | Replaces structured tool output with a smaller representation | ✅ Active |
| Schema compression | `tool.definition` | Compresses tool descriptions and JSON Schemas | ✅ Active |

Install the plugin globally, then restart OpenCode:

```bash
make opencode-install
```

The installer creates a `tokenless.js` symbolic link in OpenCode's global
`plugins/` directory and never overwrites an existing unmanaged file. It honors
`OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, and the explicit
`TOKENLESS_OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` override.

## DeepSeek Harness Plugin

The native DSH bundle compresses successful single-block JSON tool results
through `tools/post-execute` and keeps the original result unless the Tokenless
CLI returns strictly smaller valid JSON. Content-retrieval tools remain
lossless by default. Environment-error attribution stays active when response
compression is disabled, skipped, or unable to reduce the result.

Enable the bundle for every desired DSH profile in one command by repeating
`--profile`:

```bash
anolisa adapter enable tokenless dsh \
  --profile web \
  --profile headless
```

Each enable or re-enable treats the supplied profiles as the complete desired
set. It removes the bundle from profiles recorded by the prior receipt but
omitted from the new command, so always include every profile that should keep
Tokenless. Each name must match a profile passed to `dsh --profile <profile>`.
Configuration belongs in that profile's `cordis.patch.yml`; see the
[DeepSeek Harness integration reference](../../docs/user-guide/en/token-saving/tokenless/framework-integration.md#deepseek-harness-native-processing)
for every option and default.

## AgentScope Framework Integration

AgentScope 1.0.11 through 1.0.x and AgentScope 2.0.x applications install two same-version Python
wheels explicitly.
The framework integration uses the `anolisa-tokenless` runtime directly and
does not start a CLI subprocess. Neither Python package is currently published
to a package index. Build and install both wheels from a source checkout:

```bash
make python-wheel agentscope-wheel
python -m pip install \
  target/wheels/anolisa_tokenless-*.whl \
  target/wheels/anolisa_tokenless_agentscope-*.whl
```

The public entry point and configuration are the same across both major
versions. AgentScope 1.x and 2.x expose different lifecycle hooks, so only the
final attachment step differs.

AgentScope 1.x uses a Tokenless Toolkit so tools registered before or after
Agent construction, including MCP tools, receive the same lifecycle handling.
Installation requires an explicit session identifier.

```python
from agentscope.agent import ReActAgent
from tokenless_agentscope import TokenlessAgentScope, TokenlessConfig

integration = TokenlessAgentScope(
    TokenlessConfig(
        mode="balanced",
        data_dir="/absolute/path/to/tenant-tokenless-data",
    ),
)
toolkit = integration.create_toolkit()
toolkit.register_tool_function(application_tool)
agent = ReActAgent(..., toolkit=toolkit)
integration.install(agent, session_id="conversation-id")
```

AgentScope 2.x receives the retrieval Tool and middleware during construction;
this works from 2.0.0 and does not depend on mutable Toolkit APIs added in later
patch versions.

```python
from agentscope.agent import Agent
from agentscope.tool import Toolkit
from tokenless_agentscope import TokenlessAgentScope, TokenlessConfig

integration = TokenlessAgentScope(
    TokenlessConfig(
        mode="balanced",
        data_dir="/absolute/path/to/tenant-tokenless-data",
        # retrieve_tool_name="tenant_tokenless_retrieve",
    ),
)
toolkit = Toolkit(tools=[*application_tools, *integration.tools])

agent = Agent(
    ...,
    toolkit=toolkit,
    middlewares=integration.middlewares,
)
```

AgentScope App is supported from 2.0.1. It derives an isolated Tokenless data
directory for every user/agent/session below the configured absolute base
directory:

```python
from agentscope.app import create_app

app = create_app(..., **integration.app_options())
```

Set a unique `retrieve_tool_name` in `TokenlessConfig` if the application
already defines `tokenless_retrieve`; App assembly does not expose the other
tools to this factory for a preflight collision check.

AgentScope 2.0.0 does not expose App-level Agent middleware or Tool injection,
so that patch release supports direct Agent construction only. The existing
`TokenlessMiddleware` 2.x API remains available for compatibility; new code
should use `TokenlessAgentScope` so it does not depend on patch-specific
Toolkit mutation or automatic Tool collection.

| Mode | Policy |
|---|---|
| `conservative` | Compress every non-excluded tool with 1 MiB / 65,536 / depth 32 limits |
| `balanced` | Skip Read/Glob/Grep; use 65,536 / 128 / depth 8 for Shell and conservative limits elsewhere |
| `aggressive` | Skip Read/Glob/Grep; use CLI defaults of 4,096 / 32 / depth 8 elsewhere |

`balanced` is the default. The read-only retrieval Tool is published to the
model only when a marker is visible and accepts only a hash from the exact
marker set retained for that model call. Pass a different absolute `data_dir`
to each user or tenant for direct Agents;
`TOKENLESS_DATA_DIR` is only a process-wide fallback when `data_dir` is omitted.
Retain the default one-hour stash TTL unless the application has a deliberate
lifecycle policy, and do not expect retrieval across nodes.

Both AgentScope adapters enable schema compression, RTK command rewriting,
response compression, TOON, retrieval, environment-error guidance, and
per-call attribution. The native wheel contains RTK and links TOON directly;
it does not search for system executables. Host objects and streaming chunks
remain unchanged; only copied call arguments and final model-visible text are
transformed. Tool Ready remains hard-disabled.

## Raw Packaging

Raw packaging accepts already-built `tokenless` and `rtk`
executables in one directory and applies the stable component payload layout:

```bash
make package-raw \
  BIN_DIR="$PWD/target/release-bins" \
  TARGET_OS=linux \
  TARGET_ARCH=aarch64 \
  OUTPUT_DIR="$PWD/dist"
```

Supported raw targets are `linux-x86_64`, `linux-aarch64`, and
`macos-aarch64`. `darwin`/`arm64` and `amd64`/`x64` are accepted as input
aliases, while artifact names always use the canonical ANOLISA labels. The
packer verifies the ELF or Mach-O architecture without executing cross-target
binaries, embeds the component-owned `.anolisa/component.toml`, materializes
adapter hook symlinks, and emits a reproducible
`tokenless-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz` archive. Set `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` when
the caller needs an epoch other than the source commit time.

npm packaging also accepts prebuilt `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `darwin-x64`,
and `darwin-arm64` binary directories under `target/npm-prebuilt`. The packer
validates and assembles them:

```bash
node npm/scripts/package-npm.js --all
```

See [npm/README.md](npm/README.md#packaging-for-npm) for the fixed directory
layout and single-target interface.
