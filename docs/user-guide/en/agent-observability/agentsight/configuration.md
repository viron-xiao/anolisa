# AgentSight Configuration

[中文版](../../../zh/agent-observability/agentsight/configuration.md)

AgentSight reads one JSON file: `/etc/agentsight/config.json` (override with `--config`).
It controls which processes are traced, which features run, and how much memory the pipeline may
use. The reference copy shipped with the source is `src/agentsight/agentsight.json`.

## Two rules to know before you edit

1. **Your file replaces the built-in defaults; it does not extend them.** If your `cmdline.allow`
   list omits a rule, that Agent is no longer discovered. Always start from the shipped file and
   add to it.
2. **Reload instead of restart.** After editing, run `sudo systemctl reload agentsight.service`.
   The supervisor restarts both workers so they re-read the file; tracing resumes within seconds.

## Feature switches

Everything under `features` can be turned off independently. A disabled feature is not
instantiated at all, so it costs no memory and no I/O.

| Feature | JSON path | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Token accounting | `features.token_stats` | `true` | Core capability: per-Agent, per-model Token counting |
| Local tokenizer | `features.tokenizer.enabled` | `false` | Hugging Face tokenizer fallback when the provider returns no usage block |
| Session mapping | `features.session_mapping.enabled` | `true` | Maps provider response IDs to Agent session IDs |
| SQLite storage | `features.sqlite_storage.enabled` | `true` | Local persistence; off means a no-op store and an empty Dashboard |
| Interruption detection | `features.interruption_detection.enabled` | `true` | Detects failures, stalls, and loops |
| Audit | `features.audit` | `true` | Persists LLM calls and process actions |
| Token consumption records | `features.token_consumption` | `false` | Extra aggregated consumption records |
| External log export | `features.sls_logtail` | `false` | Writes structured events to a log file for an external collector |
| Trajectory collection | `features.trajectory_collection.enabled` | `false` | Periodically scans local Agent JSONL sessions into `trajectories.db` (trace mode only) |

Tuning knobs that come with a feature:

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `features.tokenizer.cache_size` | `4` | Number of tokenizer models kept in memory |
| `features.session_mapping.max_entries` | `10000` | Bound of the response-ID → session-ID map |
| `features.sqlite_storage.batch.max_size` | `100` | Rows per write batch |
| `features.sqlite_storage.batch.flush_ms` | `100` | Maximum batch delay in milliseconds |
| `features.interruption_detection.retention_days` | `30` | How long interruption events are kept |
| `features.interruption_detection.max_db_size_mb` | `100` | Size cap for `interruption_events.db` |
| `features.trajectory_collection.scan_interval_secs` | `30` | Scan interval for the trajectory collector |

## Runtime limits

These bound every in-memory buffer in the pipeline. Raise them for very busy hosts; lower them for
memory-constrained ones. `MemoryMax=350M` in the packaged systemd unit assumes roughly the defaults.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `event_channel_capacity` | `10000` | Bounded probe → pipeline channel |
| `event_channel_policy` | `backpressure` | Behaviour when the channel is full: `backpressure`, `drop_newest`, `sample` |
| `pending_genai_max_count` | `1000` | Events waiting for a session ID |
| `pending_genai_max_bytes_mb` | `64` | Byte cap for the same queue |
| `pid_cache_size` | `1024` | PID → Agent name LRU entries |
| `max_connection_body_mb` | `8` | Body buffer per HTTP connection |
| `connection_idle_timeout_secs` | `60` | Idle timeout before a connection buffer is dropped |
| `ring_buffer_mb` | `32` | eBPF ring buffer size; must be a power of two |

## Agent discovery rules

`cmdline.allow` decides which processes count as Agents and what name they get. Each rule is a list
of command-line tokens with `*` wildcards; all tokens must match in order.

```json
{ "rule": ["*node*", "*claude*"], "agent_name": "Claude" }
```

matches a process whose first argument contains `node` and whose next argument contains `claude`.

The shipped file covers Hermes, Codex, Runloop, cosh (`Cosh`), cosh-ng (`CoshNG`), OpenClaw,
Claude Code, Qwen Code, and AgentScope — 31 rules in total.

To add your own Agent, append a rule and reload:

```json
{ "rule": ["*python*", "*my_agent*"], "agent_name": "MyAgent" }
```

```bash
sudo systemctl reload agentsight.service
```

Then run your Agent and confirm the tracer picked it up — data appearing is the proof that the rule
is live:

```bash
sudo agentsight summary --last 1        # sessions and Tokens should be non-zero
sudo agentsight audit --last 1 --type llm --json | jq -r '.[].extra.model'
```

> `agentsight discover` and `discover --list-known` build their scanner from the rule set embedded in
> the binary and accept no `--config`, so they keep reporting the built-in 31 rules and will not show
> your addition even when the tracer is using it. Verify through captured data instead, and check
> `journalctl -u agentsight.service` if nothing arrives.

`cmdline.deny` removes matches that would otherwise be traced — the default entry keeps
`sftp-server` subprocesses out of the data.

Two practical points:

- A Rust or Go Agent binary is not matched by `node*`-style rules. Add a rule for the binary name.
- Wrapper processes matter. cosh-ng spawns `cosh-shell` and `cosh-core`, so both have rules.

## Endpoint rules

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `https` | Domains whose TLS traffic is decrypted through uprobes. Add your provider domain here if it is missing. |
| `http` | Plaintext HTTP targets captured through the TCP probe. |

```json
"https": [
  { "rule": ["dashscope.aliyuncs.com"] },
  { "rule": ["api.openai.com"] },
  { "rule": ["my-gateway.internal"] }
]
```

## Dashboard authentication

```json
"server": { "auth": { "enabled": true } }
```

Token authentication is on by default. Loopback requests skip it; remote requests need the token.
Set `enabled` to `false` only on a trusted internal network — see
[Dashboard guide](dashboard.md#authentication).

## Dead-loop auto-stop

```json
"deadloop": { "enabled": false, "kill_after_count": 3 }
```

Off by default. When enabled, AgentSight terminates an Agent process after it repeats the same
tool-call loop `kill_after_count` times. Detection and reporting of dead loops work regardless;
this switch only controls whether AgentSight acts. See
[Interruption detection](interruption-detection.md#dead-loop-handling).

## External log export

```json
"runtime": { "sls_logtail_path": "" },
"features": { "sls_logtail": false }
```

A non-empty `runtime.sls_logtail_path` activates file-based export of structured events for an
external log collector, and the path can be changed while AgentSight is running. Leave it empty to
keep everything local. See [Data and storage](data-and-storage.md#external-log-export).

## Codex offsets

`codex_offsets` holds per-version symbol offsets for Codex CLI, which statically links its TLS
library and exports no symbols. AgentSight tries the symbol table, then byte-pattern matching, then
this table. If a new Codex release is not captured, regenerate the entry with
`src/agentsight/scripts/extract-codex-offsets.py`.

## schema_version and upgrades

`schema_version` (currently `2`) marks the config format. On start, AgentSight compares it with the
built-in version:

- equal or newer → your file is left untouched;
- missing or older → AgentSight copies your file to `config.json.bak.<unix-seconds>`, then writes a
  merged file: it starts from the current defaults and overlays every top-level key you had set
  (`cmdline`, `https`, `features`, `codex_offsets`, …), finally bumping `schema_version`.

The merge is shallow and per top-level key, so a section you customised is kept as a whole while new
sections from the defaults are added. That also means a partially customised `cmdline` block stays
partial — the replace-not-extend rule above still applies.

RPM upgrades use `%config(noreplace)`, so the file on disk survives package upgrades and this check
handles format changes.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AGENTSIGHT_GENAI_DB_MAX_SIZE_MB` | Size cap for the GenAI event database (default 200) |
| `AGENTSIGHT_TOKENIZER_PATH` | Directory holding local tokenizer models |
| `AGENTSIGHT_ENFORCER_SOCKET` | Enforcer socket path (default `/run/agentsight/enforcer.sock`) |
| `AGENTSIGHT_CHROME_TRACE` | Writes a Chrome trace file for pipeline profiling |
| `RUST_LOG` | Log level, e.g. `RUST_LOG=debug` |

## Verify a change

```bash
sudo systemctl reload agentsight.service
systemctl is-active agentsight.service
sudo agentsight summary --last 1
```

If the service refuses to come back, the file is usually invalid JSON:

```bash
python3 -m json.tool /etc/agentsight/config.json > /dev/null && echo "JSON ok"
journalctl -u agentsight.service -n 30 --no-pager
```
