# AgentSight Deployment

[中文版](../../../zh/agent-observability/agentsight/deployment.md)

AgentSight runs as two workers: `agentsight trace` (eBPF capture, needs root) and
`agentsight serve` (API + Dashboard). Every deployment form below is a different way to start those
two.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Value |
|---|---|
| OS | Linux x86_64 |
| Kernel | >= 5.8 with BTF (`/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux` must exist) |
| Privileges | root, or `CAP_BPF` + `CAP_PERFMON` |
| Build toolchain (source only) | Rust >= 1.80, clang/llvm >= 15, libbpf >= 0.8, Node.js for the Dashboard |

clang 14 and older optimise away a length clamp the eBPF verifier requires, so `sslsniff` and
`tcpsniff` fail to load. Use clang 15+ when building from source.

## Packaged install with systemd (recommended)

```bash
sudo anolisa install agentsight        # or: sudo yum install agentsight
sudo systemctl enable --now agentsight.service
```

Two units are installed:

| Unit | Role |
|---|---|
| `agentsight.service` | Runs `/usr/local/bin/agentsight-start`, which supervises `agentsight trace` and `agentsight serve --host 0.0.0.0` |
| `agentsight-enforcer.service` | Optional ActPlane enforcement daemon; pulled in by the main unit and required for the Risk Enforcement page |

What the packaged unit gives you:

- `Restart=on-failure` with `RestartSec=10`, capped at 10 restarts per day;
- `CPUQuota=30%` and `MemoryMax=350M`, sized for the default `runtime_limits`;
- `UMask=0077`, so data under `/var/log/sysak/.agentsight` is root-only;
- `systemctl reload` sends `SIGHUP`, and the supervisor restarts both workers so they re-read
  `config.json` — no full restart needed.

```bash
systemctl status agentsight.service
journalctl -u agentsight.service -n 50 --no-pager
sudo systemctl reload agentsight.service     # after editing config.json
```

Because the unit binds the Dashboard to `0.0.0.0`, restrict TCP 7396 in your firewall or cloud
security group before exposing the host.

## Foreground run for troubleshooting

Only one tracer should run at a time, so stop the service first:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop agentsight.service

# terminal 1
sudo agentsight trace -v

# terminal 2
sudo agentsight serve
```

Restore normal operation with `sudo systemctl start agentsight.service`.

## Source build

```bash
cd src/agentsight

# Anolis / Alibaba Cloud Linux / CentOS / RHEL
sudo yum install -y openssl-devel elfutils-libelf-devel perl-IPC-Cmd libbpf-devel clang llvm bpftool

make build-all          # Dashboard frontend + agentsight + agentsight-enforcer
sudo ./target/release/agentsight trace &
sudo ./target/release/agentsight serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

`make build` alone skips the enforcer and `serve` then logs `AgentSight enforcement unavailable` at
every start.

## Containers and sidecars

eBPF probes need capabilities the default container profile does not grant:

```bash
docker run --cap-add CAP_BPF --cap-add CAP_PERFMON \
  -v /sys/kernel/btf:/sys/kernel/btf:ro \
  -p 7396:7396 <image>
```

The ANOLISA container entrypoint (`docker/docker-entrypoint.sh`) already follows this rule: it
checks for `cap_bpf`/`cap_sys_admin`, starts `agentsight-start` when they are present, and otherwise
prints the exact `docker run` flags to add instead of failing silently.

For a Kubernetes sidecar, the same three things matter:

1. capabilities — `securityContext.capabilities.add: ["BPF", "PERFMON"]`, or `privileged: true` on
   platforms that do not support fine-grained eBPF capabilities;
2. host visibility — the sidecar must share the Agent container's PID namespace
   (`shareProcessNamespace: true`) so it can see Agent processes and attach uprobes;
3. BTF — mount `/sys/kernel/btf` read-only from the host.

Keep the Dashboard port inside the cluster and reach it through a Service or port-forward rather
than exposing 7396 publicly.

## macOS

macOS builds contain no eBPF. Two commands exist:

| Command | Behaviour on macOS |
|---|---|
| `agentsight trace` | Trajectory collector only: scans local Agent JSONL session files, converts them to ATIF v1.7, stores them in `trajectories.db` |
| `agentsight serve` | Dashboard and trajectory viewer over that database |

```bash
cd src/agentsight && make build-mac
./target/release/agentsight trace     # terminal 1
./target/release/agentsight serve     # terminal 2
```

`--db` and `--config` are Linux-only, and Token/audit/interruption commands are unavailable.

## Upgrade

```bash
sudo systemctl stop agentsight.service
sudo yum update agentsight            # or: sudo anolisa install agentsight
sudo systemctl start agentsight.service
agentsight --version
```

RPM keeps your `/etc/agentsight/config.json` (`%config(noreplace)`). If the new release bumps
`schema_version`, AgentSight copies your file to `config.json.bak.<unix-seconds>` on the next start
and writes a merged one: current defaults with your top-level customisations overlaid, so your Agent
rules survive the upgrade. Databases carry over; no migration step is needed.

## Uninstall

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now agentsight.service
sudo yum remove agentsight             # or: sudo anolisa uninstall agentsight

# optional: drop collected data
sudo rm -rf /var/log/sysak/.agentsight
```

## Hardening checklist

| Item | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Dashboard exposure | Keep `--host 127.0.0.1` where possible; otherwise firewall TCP 7396 |
| Authentication | Leave `server.auth.enabled` at `true`; the token file is `0600` and root-owned |
| Data directory | Leave the private umask in place; captured prompts and responses live there |
| Log export | Leave `runtime.sls_logtail_path` empty unless an external collector needs the events |
| Resource limits | Keep `CPUQuota`/`MemoryMax` from the packaged unit when running custom units |
