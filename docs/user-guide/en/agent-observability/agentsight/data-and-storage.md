# AgentSight Data and Storage

[中文版](../../../zh/agent-observability/agentsight/data-and-storage.md)

Everything AgentSight captures stays on the host in SQLite databases. The Dashboard, the CLI, and
the HTTP API are three views over the same files.

## Where the data lives

All databases sit in `/var/log/sysak/.agentsight/`, created with a private umask so only root can
read them.

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `genai_events.db` | The main store: one row per LLM call with request/response messages, tool calls, Tokens, timings, session and conversation IDs |
| `agentsight.db` | Audit records (LLM calls and process actions) and Token consumption aggregates |
| `interruption_events.db` | Detected interruptions with their type, severity, and evidence |
| `optimization.db` | Results of Dashboard optimization analyses |
| `trajectories.db` | ATIF v1.7 trajectories, only when `features.trajectory_collection` is enabled |
| `.dashboard_token` | The Dashboard access token (64 hex characters, root-only) |
| `optimization_config.json` | LLM settings entered on the Dashboard Settings page (API key stored here) |
| `*.db-wal`, `*.db-shm` | SQLite write-ahead log and shared memory; normal, and checkpointed on clean shutdown |

`--db` on `serve`, `dashboard`, and `skill-metrics` points at a different database file, which is
how you browse a copy or an archive. The tracer itself always writes to the default directory.

> `--db` only redirects the GenAI event store. `serve` still reads interruption events from
> `/var/log/sysak/.agentsight`, so an archived copy shows its own sessions and Tokens next to the
> live host's interruptions. To browse an archive in full isolation, point the whole data directory
> at it (for example with a bind mount) instead of using `--db`.

> These files contain full prompts and model responses. Treat them as sensitive: keep the directory
> permissions as installed, and be careful when copying them off the host.

## Retention and size limits

| Store | Limit | How to change it |
|---|---|---|
| `genai_events.db` | 200 MB by default; pruning starts at 90% of the cap and removes the oldest 5% of records per pass | `AGENTSIGHT_GENAI_DB_MAX_SIZE_MB=500` in the service environment |
| `interruption_events.db` | 30 days and 100 MB | `features.interruption_detection.retention_days` / `max_db_size_mb` |

To raise the GenAI cap for the packaged service:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit agentsight.service
# [Service]
# Environment=AGENTSIGHT_GENAI_DB_MAX_SIZE_MB=500
sudo systemctl restart agentsight.service
```

Check current usage:

```bash
sudo du -sh /var/log/sysak/.agentsight
sudo ls -la /var/log/sysak/.agentsight
```

## Clearing data

```bash
sudo systemctl stop agentsight.service
sudo rm -rf /var/log/sysak/.agentsight
sudo systemctl start agentsight.service
```

Removing the directory also removes the Dashboard token, so a new one is generated on the next
start. To keep the history instead, copy the directory somewhere safe and browse it later with
`agentsight serve --db /path/to/genai_events.db`.

## HTTP API

The server publishes its own route inventory, so you never have to guess:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7396/api/docs | python3 -m json.tool
```

Requests from anywhere other than loopback need the token:

```bash
TOKEN=$(sudo cat /var/log/sysak/.agentsight/.dashboard_token)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://<host>:7396/api/sessions
```

Endpoint groups in 0.11:

| Group | Examples | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Service | `GET /health`, `GET /metrics`, `GET /api/docs` | Liveness, Prometheus metrics, route list (`/health` and `/metrics` are loopback-only) |
| Authentication | `GET /api/auth/status`, `GET /api/auth/verify`, `POST /api/auth/login` | Auth state, capability list, token → cookie exchange |
| Sessions and traces | `GET /api/sessions`, `GET /api/sessions/{id}/traces`, `GET /api/traces/{id}`, `GET /api/conversations/{id}`, `POST /api/sessions/search` | Session list, per-session traces, single call detail, semantic search |
| Metrics | `GET /api/timeseries`, `GET /api/metrics/latency`, `GET /api/agent-names` | Token time series, latency percentiles, Agent filter values |
| Interruptions | `GET /api/interruptions`, `/count`, `/stats`, `/session-counts`, `/conversation-counts`, `POST /api/interruptions/{id}/resolve` | Triage and resolution |
| Agent health | `GET /api/agent-health`, `DELETE /api/agent-health/{pid}`, `POST /api/agent-health/{pid}/restart` | Live Agent state and recovery actions |
| Token savings | `GET /api/token-savings`, `GET /api/token-savings/session/{id}` | Tokenless savings |
| ATIF export | `GET /api/export/atif/session/{id}` (also `trace` and `conversation`) | Trajectory export |
| Trajectories | `GET /api/trajectories`, `/filters`, `/{session_id}` | Collected trajectories |
| Skill metrics | `GET /api/skill-metrics`, `/downloads`, `/loads`, `/usage-ratio`, `/distribution`, `/hotness` | Skill adoption |
| Optimization | `POST /api/optimize/sessions/{id}/{dimension}`, `GET /api/optimize/results`, `GET` and `POST /api/optimize/config` | LLM-assisted analysis |
| Quality and attribution | `POST /api/grader/evaluate`, `GET /api/grader/latest`, `POST /api/causal-attribution` | Session quality scoring, root-cause attribution |
| Security and audit | `GET /api/security/*`, `GET /api/audit/*`, `POST /api/audit/cases/{id}/review` | Present when agent-sec-core is installed |
| Enforcement | `GET /api/enforcement/health`, `POST /api/enforcement/bindings`, `GET /api/enforcement/violations` | Present when the enforcer is installed; mutations always require the token |

Time ranges are nanosecond epochs (`start_ns`, `end_ns`), matching the CLI's `--last` window.

```bash
# last hour of sessions
NOW=$(date +%s%N); AGO=$((NOW - 3600000000000))
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:7396/api/sessions?start_ns=$AGO&end_ns=$NOW" | python3 -m json.tool | head
```

## Prometheus metrics

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7396/metrics | head
```

```
# HELP agentsight_token_input_total Total input tokens consumed by agent (all-time)
# TYPE agentsight_token_input_total counter
agentsight_token_input_total{agent="CoshNG"} 100000
agentsight_token_input_total{agent="Cosh"} 50000
```

Counters are per Agent and all-time: `agentsight_token_input_total`,
`agentsight_token_output_total`, `agentsight_token_total_total`, `agentsight_llm_requests_total`.
`/metrics` is loopback-only, so scrape it with a node-local Prometheus agent or expose it through a
local reverse proxy. `agentsight metrics` prints the same content from the CLI.

## Trajectory export (ATIF v1.7)

Any session, conversation, or single trace exports as a self-contained JSON trajectory — Agent
metadata, steps, messages, tool calls, and Token totals:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7396/api/export/atif/session/<SESSION_ID> > session.atif.json
```

The Dashboard's Trajectory Viewer offers the same file through **Download JSON**, and can re-import
one captured on another host. Use it for offline analysis, sharing a reproduction, or feeding
evaluation pipelines.

## External log export

AgentSight can write structured events to a file for an external log collector to pick up:

```json
{
  "runtime": { "sls_logtail_path": "/var/log/anolisa/agentsight/events.jsonl" },
  "features": { "sls_logtail": true }
}
```

The path can be changed while AgentSight runs — set it to `""` to pause export. Leave both settings
at their defaults if you want the data to stay entirely local. Collector-side configuration
(endpoints, credentials) is out of scope for AgentSight.

## Backup

```bash
sudo systemctl stop agentsight.service
sudo tar czf agentsight-data-$(date +%F).tar.gz -C /var/log/sysak .agentsight
sudo systemctl start agentsight.service
```

Stopping the service first ensures the WAL is checkpointed, so the archive is consistent.
