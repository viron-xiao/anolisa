# Installation Guide

[中文版](../zh/installation.md)

This guide covers the progressive installation of ANOLISA — from the CLI tool to individual components and adapter setup.

---

## Step 1: Install the ANOLISA CLI

The `anolisa` CLI is the unified entry point for managing all ANOLISA components.

### Option A: Install script (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.agentic-os.sh | bash
```

The same installer can manage one published component immediately after it
prepares the CLI. Pass the registry name, backend, and scope. Raw is the
default backend. On Alibaba Cloud Linux 4, install cosh-ng through the RPM
backend so dnf selects the matching system libraries:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.agentic-os.sh | bash -s -- --component cosh-ng --backend rpm --install-mode system
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

`--cosh-ng` is shorthand for `--component cosh-ng`. Component, backend, and
platform checks remain owned by the CLI, so the installer does not maintain a
second component allowlist. In explicit system mode, the script uses `sudo`
only for the component action; the CLI remains in the current user directory.
Without `--install-mode`, scope follows the normal ANOLISA euid default.

### Option B: YUM (Alinux)

```bash
sudo yum install anolisa
```

After installation, verify:

```bash
anolisa --version
```

Before installing a component that uses the current raw package contract,
update an older CLI through the tool that owns it:

```bash
# CLI installed by get.agentic-os.sh
anolisa update self

# RPM-owned CLI
sudo anolisa update self
```

AgentSecCore requires `anolisa` 0.2.17 or later. The CLI reports an update hint
and stops before changing the host when it cannot safely read a package
contract.

---

## Step 2: Environment Detection

Run the environment check to identify your system capabilities:

```bash
anolisa env
```

This displays:
- OS and architecture
- Available filesystems (btrfs for ws-ckpt)
- FUSE availability (for skillfs)
- Installed Agent runtimes (cosh, OpenClaw, Hermes)
- Kernel features (eBPF for agentsight)

---

## Step 3: Install Components

Install components individually based on your needs:

```bash
anolisa install <component>
```

### Available Components

| Component | Description | Supported modes |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `cosh` | Copilot Shell — AI terminal assistant | user, system |
| `cosh-ng` | AI-native terminal and deterministic Agent runtime (experimental) | system (Linux), user or system (macOS arm64) |
| `os-skills` | System management and DevOps skills | user, system |
| `tokenless` | Token optimization (compression) | user, system |
| `ws-ckpt` | Workspace checkpoint/rollback | **system** |
| `skillfs` | FUSE virtual skill filesystem | **system** |
| `agent-memory` | MCP-based persistent memory | user, system |
| `agentsight` | eBPF tracing and dashboard | **system** |
| `sec-core` | Local security runtime, scanners, and adapters | **system** |

> **Note**: System-only components require `sudo` and an explicit system scope:
> ```bash
> sudo anolisa --install-mode system install agentsight
> ```

On Alibaba Cloud Linux 4, install cosh-ng from the RPM backend in system mode,
then start the terminal with `cosh`:

```bash
sudo anolisa --install-mode system install cosh-ng --backend rpm
cosh
```

The public installer combines CLI bootstrap and component installation:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.agentic-os.sh | bash -s -- --component cosh-ng --backend rpm --install-mode system
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

On macOS arm64, the cosh-ng raw package has a separate user-scope contract:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.agentic-os.sh | bash -s -- --component cosh-ng --backend raw --install-mode user
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Use the component name `sec-core` with the ANOLISA CLI. The Alinux RPM keeps
its package name `agent-sec-core`:

```bash
sudo anolisa --install-mode system install sec-core

# If you install the RPM directly, let ANOLISA track it before adapter setup
sudo yum install anolisa agent-sec-core
sudo anolisa --install-mode system adopt sec-core
```

Continue to [Step 4](#step-4-adapter-setup), then run
`anolisa adapter enable sec-core <framework>` as the user who owns the target
Agent configuration.

### Install All Components

```bash
anolisa install --all
```

### YUM Alternative (Alinux)

For each component, you can also use YUM. Install the system CLI in the same
transaction so sudo can find it without relying on a user-local PATH. A direct
RPM installation does not create an ANOLISA state record, so adopt it before
using lifecycle or adapter commands:

```bash
sudo yum install anolisa <rpm-package>
sudo anolisa --install-mode system adopt <component>
```

---

## Step 4: Adapter Setup

Adapters bridge components to specific Agent frameworks. Enable an adapter after installing the component:

```bash
anolisa adapter scan
anolisa adapter enable <component> [framework]
```

### Examples

```bash
# Tokenless hook for cosh
/usr/share/tokenless/scripts/install.sh --cosh

# Tokenless plugin for OpenClaw
/usr/share/tokenless/scripts/install.sh --openclaw

# ws-ckpt plugin for OpenClaw
ws-ckpt plugin install --runtime openclaw

# ws-ckpt plugin for Hermes
ws-ckpt plugin install --runtime hermes

# AgentSecCore plugin for OpenClaw
anolisa adapter enable sec-core openclaw
```

The system installation owns the component files. Adapter enablement runs as
the user who owns the target Agent configuration, so it does not need `sudo`
for a normal user-scoped framework installation.

---

## Step 5: Start Long-running Services

Installing a component and starting its resident service are separate actions.
AgentSight installs `agentsight.service` and its enforcer dependency without
enabling either unit. Start the main unit when the machine is ready to collect
events:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now agentsight.service
sudo systemctl status agentsight.service
```

The main unit runs eBPF tracing and the Dashboard together as root and keeps its
data private under `/var/log/sysak/.agentsight`. Use `sudo` for commands that
query service data. For foreground troubleshooting, stop the unit first, then
run the tracer and server as root in separate terminals:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop agentsight.service

# Terminal 1
sudo agentsight trace

# Terminal 2
sudo agentsight serve
```

---

## Step 6: Verify Installation

Check the status of all installed components:

```bash
anolisa status
```

Run the built-in diagnostic:

```bash
anolisa doctor
```

---

## Uninstallation

Remove a specific component:

```bash
anolisa uninstall <component>
```

The public installer also accepts an installed component name for removal. It
refreshes the stable CLI first, then delegates to `anolisa uninstall`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.agentic-os.sh | bash -s -- --component cosh-ng --install-mode system --uninstall
```

There is no batch uninstall command. List the installed records, then remove
each intended component explicitly so its authority and package-removal policy
are reviewed independently:

```bash
anolisa list --installed
anolisa uninstall <component>
```

---

## Upgrade

Update a specific component:

```bash
anolisa update <component>
```

Update a selected component and the script-installed stable CLI together:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.agentic-os.sh | bash -s -- --component cosh-ng --install-mode system --upgrade
```

Update all installed components:

```bash
anolisa update all
```

`update all` updates recorded components but not the CLI binary. Use
`anolisa update self` for a script-installed CLI or `sudo anolisa update self`
for an RPM-owned CLI.
