# cosh-ng Quick Start

[中文版](../../../zh/user-entrypoint/cosh-ng/QUICKSTART.md)

cosh-ng starts in Enhanced Assisted mode, where bash or zsh remains interactive
and Cosh may route natural-language requests to an Agent. Native integration is
an explicit startup choice for sessions that must load no Cosh hooks.

## 1. Install

On Alibaba Cloud Linux 4, install the ANOLISA CLI, then install cosh-ng from
the RPM backend in system scope:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.agentic-os.sh | bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
sudo "$HOME/.local/bin/anolisa" --install-mode system install cosh-ng --backend rpm
```

The public installer can combine the CLI and component installation. It prompts
for `sudo` only when running the component action:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.agentic-os.sh | bash -s -- --cosh-ng --backend rpm --install-mode system
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

On macOS arm64, use user scope instead:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.agentic-os.sh | bash -s -- --cosh-ng --backend raw --install-mode user
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Alibaba Cloud Linux 4 users can also install the RPM directly:

```bash
sudo yum install cosh-ng
```

Verify both user-facing commands:

```bash
cosh --version
cosh-cli --version
```

Package and service changes normally need root privileges. Workspace checkpoint commands also need a running `ws-ckpt` daemon.

The published Linux raw contract is not currently portable across all routed
distributions, so it is not the recommended Linux installation path. The raw
package supports macOS arm64, where Linux-only package and service operations
remain unavailable. Source builds are for contributors; follow the
[developer setup](../../../../developer-guide/en/cosh-ng/getting-started.md)
after the packaged options above.

## 2. Start the terminal

Start `cosh` in the project or system directory where the Agent should work:

```bash
cd your-project
cosh
```

The default Enhanced Assisted mode uses `◇ ` to show that submitted input may
be classified and routed before Shell execution:

```text
◇ user@host:~/project$ git status
◇ user@host:~/project$ investigate the last failed deployment
```

At an empty prompt, `Shift+Tab` switches to Enhanced Shell-only. The prefix
becomes `◌ `, ordinary input stays with the Shell, and post-command insights
remain available. Press `Shift+Tab` again to return to Assisted.

Start Native when the session must have no Cosh hooks, observation, or insight:

```bash
COSH_SHELL_INTEGRATION=native cosh
```

Native and Enhanced integration are selected at startup; restart `cosh` to
change between them. The Assisted and Shell-only substates switch in place.

When an operation needs consent, cosh shows an approval or question card before it proceeds.

Useful first commands in Enhanced Assisted mode:

```text
/auth
/help
/status
/mode approval recommend
/session list
```

`/auth` chooses or updates provider authentication, `/help` lists slash commands, `/status` shows runtime and session status, `/mode approval recommend` asks for confirmation before each Agent tool call, and `/session list` lists resumable conversations in this workspace.

Use `/session list --all` to include conversations from other workspaces. Resume a conversation from the workspace where it was created.

## 3. Reuse Skills

List and inspect Skills available to the current workspace:

```text
/skills list
/skills detail service-health
```

Workspace, user, extension, and system Skill directories are merged by priority. See [Skills](core/skills.md) for the search order and file format.
