# Interactive Terminal

[中文版](../../../../zh/user-entrypoint/cosh-ng/shell/overview.md)

`cosh` starts in Enhanced Assisted mode. The `◇ ` prefix shows that Cosh may
route natural-language input before bash or zsh executes it. Press `Shift+Tab`
at an empty prompt for Enhanced Shell-only (`◌ `), or select Native at startup
when the session must have no Cosh hooks, observation, or insights.

## A typical workflow

1. Change to the target directory and run `cosh`.
2. Run familiar commands normally.
3. Press `Shift+Tab` when ordinary input should remain Shell-only.
4. Describe a task in Assisted mode and review cards before side effects.
5. Use `/session status` before leaving a long-running investigation.

Useful starts:

```bash
cosh
cosh --shell zsh
cosh --resume
COSH_SHELL_INTEGRATION=native cosh
```

## How input is routed

| Input | Native | Enhanced Shell-only `◌` | Enhanced Assisted `◇` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `git status` | Runs in the Shell. | Runs in the Shell; an execution insight may follow. | Runs in the Shell; an execution insight may follow. |
| `hello` | The Shell normally reports a missing command. | The Shell normally reports a missing command. | The classifier evaluates it and currently leaves this ambiguous single word to the Shell. |
| `why did the last command fail?` | The Shell handles the text. | The Shell handles the text. | Starts an Agent request with recent terminal evidence. |
| `/session list` | The Shell handles the text. | The Shell handles the text. | Runs a Cosh control command. |
| Agent tool request | Unavailable. | Available after explicitly accepting an insight or Agent entry. | Runs or shows an approval card according to the approval mode. |

Native integration does not install Cosh `DEBUG`, `RETURN`, or `ERR` traps and
does not enable `extdebug`, `functrace`, or `errtrace`. Enhanced is the default;
select Native with `shell.integration = "native"` or
`COSH_SHELL_INTEGRATION=native`. Restart `cosh` to switch integrations.
`Shift+Tab` changes only the Enhanced routing substate, without restarting.

Approved Shell commands in enhanced integration stay in the foreground Shell,
so prompts, output, job control, and `Ctrl+C` remain usable. See
[Tool approval](approval.md) for the safety rules.

## Sessions and proactive help

- Enhanced sessions are persisted by cosh-core and scoped to the workspace
  where cosh started. Recovery restores model-visible conversation context,
  not terminal processes or old terminal output. See
  [Session recovery](session-recovery.md).
- `smart` is the default analysis mode inside enhanced integration. Use
  [AI analysis](ai-analysis.md) to choose how much proactive failure help appears.
- `/help` is the source of truth for enhanced-mode commands; use
  [Interactive commands](interactive-mode.md) for a concise reference.
